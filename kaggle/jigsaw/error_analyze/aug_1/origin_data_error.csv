The comment directly above this one are from a very strange detractor of mine at cplsanchez.infoa fetish fan site authored by a somewhat disturbed individual who has an unrequited attraction to me.  This commentator was banned from this site under several names and is quite consistent about placing the same comment anywhere I write.  The commentator above insists on comparing the standards for entering the military with the FDA standards for donating blood, a ludicrous comparison by someone who has no working knowledge of the military.  I invite the contributors to look at the amateurish Cplsanchez.info, because it shows what the Matt Sanchez should not becomea childish hate site.  

I was recently the subject of a Fox News interview:  http://www.foxnews.com/video/index.html?playerId=videolandingpage&streamingFormat;=FLASH&referralObject;=8083220&referralPlaylistId;=7f634ca75753642edb5e38bcd9b77f712d735ea8","""::you wouldn't know Makoto from Street Fighter 3 was a girl if it wasn't for her dizzy animation.
Well, you could also read her bio... Leo's bio, on the other hand, doesn't say anything about a gender, or about the character trying to look like a boy.
It's pretty easy to come up with some evidence that Makoto is a girl, but I've yet to see somebody pull that off with Leo...
something which keeps coming up is that Leo is a boys name. Well considering the she's obviously trying to look like a boy (probably so Kazuya doesn't recognise her so her revenge will be easier to gain - yeah, yeah, speculation) it makes sense that she's actually called Leona and Leo is (a) a shortened version of that and (b) conveniently plays into the tomboy image.
Actually, I could think of a more plausible explanation for the name: if, like you just theorized, Leo wants to stay incognito, I would think she (assuming Leo's a """"she""""... still your theory)'d better change her name... Maybe she's not really called """"Leo"""" at all. Maybe the name is part of the """"boy"""" disguise. 'Seems more logical and simple to me, anyway.
Remember, in Japan tomboys will use """"boku"""" rather than """"watashi"""" and will get called """"kun"""" rather than """"chan"""" - all things that technically explicitly mark them as male.
Not sure why you're saying that... Does Leo refer to himself/herself as """"boku""""? Besides, if Leo is a girl posing as a young man, she could go as far as to call herself """"ore,"""" really...
Anyway... Namco kept Leo out of a list of the Tekken 6 women/girls, and the character has been said to be male several times in Japanese magazines. So if Leo is a girl, she's secretly a girl... and there has been no big reveal as of yet. In fact, there's even a possibility Namco is trying to keep Leo's real gender a riddle and has no intentions of confirming it one way or the other, ever. Yumeji (from the Samurai Spirits series) would be a precedent. 81.56.14.31

You are Wiki-Lawyering, and frankly if anybody is doing the harassing here, it's you.  You have repeatedly minimized my arguments by claiming that I am Sockpuppeting, Meatpuppeting, and making personal attacks when I am attacking the material of the article and its source.  
'You are passive aggressive' is not an egregious personal attack, and 'you didn't read what I wrote and you are being deliberately obtuse' isn't a personal attack at all.  (Seriously, How is """"You're deliberately not reading what I wrote"""" possibly offensive to anybody?)  
I didn't come here to create drama, I didn't claim that I did.  I claimed that a particular website made me aware of something on wikipedia that I thought was wrongly included in an article.  I've made legitimate criticisms, and my comments are directly responsible for the creation of the Crucifixion in Art page.  I argued civilly enough and generated enough consensus among the majority of wiki users to remove the offending material from the original Crucifixion page and have it moved to a new page.  When I got around to looking at that new page I found that it had not been cleaned up and contained questionable claims from an unreliable tertiary source, so I made an argument on the discussion page and removed the offending material.  Because I didn't make an edit summary, I found my revision rather rudely reverted by a member of one of your user:groups.  I reacted and Alan pointed out my mistake: a simple oversight by a novice user, one that might have been cleared up when I read Alan's talk page had you not immediately jumped in and made baseless claims against me.  68.114.130.234  """,2.0,1.0,0.0

Thanks for blocking me. I called Tao an idiot and a dumb bastard because I truly belive he/she is one. You have these rules to prevent harassment. Fine. I was just doing it for fun, got it out of my system, I'll quit now. However, you should seriously consider a NDB&LP; rule, or No Dumb Bastards and Lazy People. Wikipedia is currently a laughing stock, a punchline to a joke. The reason is that it facilitates lazy people like Tao. If you read the entire entry, my intention is to improve the page. I provide sources, I provide a sound argument, I provide what's necessary to provide in circumstances like this in order to improve the page. What does Tao provide? Nothing. He clearly has not read the page, he clearly does not know the subject, and he clearly is uninterested in doing what needs to be done in circumstances like this: making valid claims supported with evidence. True, I don't take Wikipedia seriously, but I believe in its potential. I wouldn't do anything that I believe harms it in a substantial way. Tao, on the other hand, is an insidious virus who does little but undermine the value of Wikipedia. In a just world, he would be the one being blocked. This is not a genuine appeal against being blocked because I'm the one who asked for it. This is an appeal for you to actually read the conversation, read my swear-filled diatribe as me antagonizing someone who is genuinely very, very, very lazy in what he is doing (how long did it take to get me blocked after I even begged and taunted?)  please tell me, of the two of us who really should be blocked?

As a fan of John Cena, I am against the hypocrisy of many of his critics for their 'Five Moves Of Doom' comments, especially since many of these people support Hogan, Boogeyman, and Batista, all of whom have not the same in-ring skill as Cena. However, it is absolutely absurd that the Five Moves are repeatedly removed by some mark-out fanboy who doesn't want anything negative said about Cena. The Five Moves are the basis of almost all criticism aimed at Cena, and therefore I have placed them back on the page, although obviously I have rephrased the wording so it is no longer biased against Cena and is entirely factual. Don't remove them again, as that is just stupid and goes against your whole 'no bias' attitude since you're biasing it in favour of Cena while also not letting people know the truth.

Never when you did obvious mistakes like placing a tag including edit warring(which was ridiculous) had you admited your mistakes. What I am saying is that what you placed as last warning does not qualify by any standard as warning material. As well, placing a block for incivility directed at your person isen't the right thing to do, usually an experienced administrator leave this sort of thing being settled by another administrator. I admit, """"he started it"""" is not an excuse, but neither is claiming that you only warn when you see things, you seem to have a rather selective sight here. I just request that you leave another administrator to handle the situation, and I consider you personally involved, of course you can ignore my considerations, but this is not the most respectful thing to do. Incivity is always the easiest thing for an administrator that does not bother to check the situation, but in comparaison to edit warring POV pushing, intimidations, suckpopetry, threats, it is absolutly nothing.

 The reasons I dont contribute to Wikipedia anymore 
Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology.  I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance. So thank you for giving me one more reason not to contribute to wikipedia.

Cube, its not a threat. I just have to do some things differently now obviously because I wasnt expecting this block at all. I have to change the way I see Wikipedia or maybe I'll just leave, I dont know. I have to take some decisions, is what I meant.
Xeno, if I have violated WP:POINT, is that a bigger offense than being rude and offensive? I dont understand how someone can be blocked for making a point, but not for saying things like """"what are you fucking on about"""" and all the other kinds of comments I gathered here. Isnt something wrong here? What is wrong is, I'll just say it: Jimbo's tolerance for rude and aggresive behavior. That may change if I get a reply from him but the fact that comments like the ones I gathered above, are being allowed to be said, without any punishment or enforcement of discipline and that, people are ok with, is a serious problem here. My """"violating"""" comment was to show that rude offensive comments are wrong and should be enforced. Thats exactly what I have proved. Did I violate WP:POINT? Actually I explicitly mentioned in my post that I was indeed trying to """"deliver a point"""" (to quote myself). The point was to show Bali that he did not like what I said because the way I said it. The problem is that such behavior is not being enforced. It is OK if I was blocked for my comment, if that was the only thing I said. The admin did the right thing. However what should have happened is that Bali should have been blocked (say even 12 hours is fine, a week would be excessive) in the first place and that did not happen. What is sad that we all couldnt even agree that rude and offensive behavior is punishable. Even George came and complained about Bali's rudeness but nothing was done and the issue was closed. As far as the enforcement of being respectful to other editors is concerned, I think its a sad state of affairs. I will be talking about the problem of rudeness at Wikipedia with more people here and outside Wikipedia.

Taelus, the reason for the unblock is simple: I (obviously) did not mean what I said. I only said it to demonstrate that no one likes to be talked to in a rude, aggressive manner like Bali did (""""what are you fucking on about""""). Basically its absurd that I've been blocked for making a """"demo"""" post of rudeness while other editors go unpunished in real situations. In summary, my unblock reason is: """"I was kidding and trying to show an example.""""

 Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park) 

Hi there, in regards to Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park), please do not re-insert that information into the article, as it fails verification. The source which was used states:

The rape of Germany left a bitter legacy. It contributed to the unpopularity of the East German communist regime and its consequent reliance on the Stasi secret police. The victims themselves were permanently traumatised: women of the wartime generation still refer to the Red Army war memorial in Berlin as """"the Tomb of the Unknown Rapist"""".

It does not state WHICH memorial, and the inclusion in this article represents original research. As a Berliner, you know there are 3 Soviet war memorials, and throwing random epitaphs into articles based upon ones guess is not encyclopaedic. There is also evidence that people have not cited the other sources, and if they keep pushing the line that they have cited the material, and reinsert it into the article, I will present evidence which proves that 1) they have not read the material at all or 2) have blatantly falsified the references for inclusion into the article, and I will be asking for sanctions against anyone who reinserts it. This has been raised on the talk page, and editors have refused to provide cites from those sources. As there is also evidence of some of these editors also engaging in original research by placing into articles things which are not mentioned in those sources, this is egregious original research, and given the nature of the information inserted, it can be seen as a blatant breach of WP:DIGWUREN.

(Eleven eyewitnesses testified they saw Ryan armed with a rifle. All fourteen eyewitnesses testified of hearing one single shot and Hodson fell to the ground. More significantly, only FOUR eyewitnesses testified actually seeing Ryan fire a shot. The was no contest that the evidence of each eyewitness were very contradictory. Purrum's infamous book goes on to describe the discrepencies in the prosecution's case, eg. the lack of scientific forensic evidence, the vital missing pieces of evidence, the downward trajectory angle of the fatal bullet, and prison officer Paterson testifying he fired the single shot that was heard by all eyewitnesses.

After all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

Anyone interested in having a look at what's going on here may want to check this link to my previous user talk page which concerns accusations by Guy Chapman that I am supposedly a spammer which is a false accusation. Just because I have been evaluating whether I should start contributing in Wikipedia or not, does not make me a spammer.

But you are making hundreds of posts on a page that is no longer current, I'm not sure what your goal is, I just ran into the page by accident, and nothing makes any sense.  

Its ok now, im sorry Armadillo ive finally worked out how to place a notice on a page which I am requesting for removal, maby thats what happened, hundreds of posts? no no, I have only placed a removal request on three articles in question have a look at my contrib log,

This is what I added to the help page but someone has deleted it today  ,

I am still waiting for the deletion of these 3 articles on the grounds that they have been edited to a point where the facts have become fiction and these three remaining articles serve no other purpose except to make the company EC0PAVE and people look bad and they dilute the trademark protected words Trademark dilution and the article is in bad faith;

 Hi thanks for taking the time to respond Avi.  I had presumed you were Muslim because it said on your talkpage that you had contributed to the Abbey Hill Mosque article.  From your response I now gather you are of the Jewish faith so sorry if I have misrepresented you at any point. Have I got that right, you are Jewish, not Muslim? I also presumed you were from the UK (which is where I am from) because you had contributed to an article on a UK mosque.  Is that right?
When I said most people are against it I meant that most people where I am from don't know much about it and if they did find out about the negative aspects of it (such as the complications (serious and minor), loss in sexual function, etc) then they would most likely take a somewhat negative view of it. I would apply this to all non-circumcising cultures.  These people may not campaign against it or join the genital integrity movement (if you could describe it as such), however they would in general have a negative view of it.  There are a few reasons as to why I think they'd view it somewhat negatively once you forced them to give their view on it. 
It is done on children without their consent.  Most people would view this as ethically wrong - to not have any say in a major alteration to a part of your body (a particularly sensitive part at that).  
It can cause pain (people generally don't like to see children in pain).  
They then might ask if there was a reason for it to be done.  They would look at the views of the medical associations (via their policy statements on RIC) and find out that it isn't a net positive operation, therefore it doesn't need to be done for health reasons.  Furthermore, those that are not circumcised would realise it is a needless operation because they had done fine being intact.
 What I am saying is that most people do view it negatively (if they know about it and are forced to choose), they just don't bother saying anything because they do not wish to cause upset to a religious community or be accused of being intolerant.  
 I am not sure what bizarre forced circumcision you are referring to.
 Regarding the term/title of the article, I don't see how calling the article Male circumcision would equate it with female circumcision.  I realise they are different operations, but they still involve cutting of the genitals.  You also cannot deny that a lot of people refer to FGM (as you would call it) as female circumcision.  Furthermore, a lot of people, when asked to define """"circumcision"""" would ask the question, """"which type? Male or female?"""" In the last post on this subject, at talk:circumcision, I said this and I don't think you or Jake responded.  I took that as meaning you didn't have a counter-argument to what I said.  My point there was that we should be as specific as possible and that being accurate is more important than using the most widely used term.  This is following the Wikipedia naming guidelines.

Hi Pigsonthewing,

As someone who has been silently observing your behaviour over the past few months on Wikipedia, I am worried by what I perceive to be a downward spiral of petty fighting, vindictiveness, childishness and bad faith on your part.

how to fix this article
In some kinds of academic discourse it's considered incorrect to use the term """"racism"""" to describe what are essentially racist actions by an oppressed minority. I understand, and even, in certain contexts agree with this. However, I don't see anything wrong with calling Black supremacy racist when were talking about the kind of Black supremacy that explicitly says that non-black people are inferior.

The problem I have with this article and the article on Black Power is that they both, at times, conflate the legitimate, if reactionary, anti-racist, black empowerment movements with cultish and fringe ideas and groups that have little or no currency in the greater US black community.

A comparison would be if you equated all people who are pro-life with skin heads. I bet there are a lot of pro-life skin heads, and both groups have a lot of white people in them but they don't really have anything to do with each other. (!)

In order to fix this article and the article on black power we need to realize that there are racist fringe groups, and describe them, and their history and motivation fairly.

I have a few questions: 

Is every group listed here a """"self described"""" black supremacy group? Or are some of these groups concerned about """"black power"""" (there is a difference!)

After all, you and your pedophile friend SweetiePetie (who is thankfully now blocked for soliciting sex from young boys on Wikipedia) have been waging war on my efforts to improve the factual quality of the Dean Gaffney article for months now.

Unfortunatly I don't have the mop, so you and your pedophile cronies have control over the Gaffney article for the moment. This whole episode is a disgusting reminder of the kind of fanatical perverts that Gaffney attracts to his fanbase, corrupt administrators and those who prey on young children.

",""":Voltaire as an egalitarian is about the funniest thing I've heard in a long time; of course he was not (and harldy any of the Enlightenment philosophes were). Does that diminish his statue as a thinker? Of course not; non-conformity with 21st-century sensibilities hardly matters in any assessment of an 18th-century thinker. As for the discussion of Voltaire's racism/anti-semitism we obviously must apply similar principles apply. Throwing in a few decontextualised quotes about Voltaire's view on Jews and black people to demonstrate that he was a raving racist is simply meaningless. If these issues are to be included in the entry at all (which I doubt they warrant), then surely they need contextualisation. For instance, Voltaire's discussion on Jews surely must be understood in the context of his general account of revealed religion, and must be set in the context of 18th-century censorship (which often led writers to attack the Jews whilst actually aiming at their Christian off-spring). Similarly, Voltaire's views on non-white people cannot be understood outside the context of his general framework of savagery, barbarism, civilisation and historical development. If people started to read Voltaire in such contexts, then they would start to understand that the question of whether Voltaire was a """"racist, anti-semitist, egalitarian, etc.""""? is pretty much meaningless and doesn't increase our understanding of him at all. However, given the above discussion, I sort of doubt whether wikipedia readers/editors understand enough history to appreciate this. In any case I give it a go, by deleting the presently pointless section on Voltaire's views on race ....

Hey, if you want to try K it can be very tough to get.  You have to either go to raves or Mexico.  But, I know a place online that ships it.  Check out http://www.globalpharm.blogspot.com

Here's the simple steps to get K delivered to your home:

1) Setup a hushmail.com email address
2) Contact globalpharmonline@hushmail.com and let him know what you want.  Here's the K they have along with prices. Make sure you tell him you want the brand Indus. The other brand they have sucks.

Ketamine 5000mg bottle $180.00
Ketamine500mg Inj 10ml Rotex Germany$25.00
Ketamine250mg Inj 5ml Indus $15.00
Ketamine 50mg Inj 2ml Indus $5.00

The 5000mg bottle = 10 (10ml) viles.  That breaks out to 5 grams powder. One 10ml vile breaks out into half a gram of powder.

It's real easy to get the liquid into powder if you don't know how to do it.  Just put it on a plate and boil water underneath it until it evaporates, then you'll be left with the powder.  You can also put the liquid on pyrex in the oven.  Be careful not to heat the liquid anymore than once it's gone otherwise you'll burn your shit.

Dude, sorry for the rough language, but you are one fucking dumbass idiot. Everything I type is extremely intelligible and free-flowing, if you will, yet you seem to interpret it WAY differently than it is obviously stated. My sentence, """"You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so"""", makes perfect sense and only an idiot would not understand it. I wrote it redundantly to prove a point, not because I lack verbal skills. The point being, that you are an idiot and you can't understand the symbolic (or even literal) nature of my posts, and you interpret it into something that somehow benefits you and your cozy little world view. Ok, this will be the 100TH time I've had to clear something up for you, but let me tell you what this sentence means:

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

And don't let these stupid americans fool you either! At one point, they considered jews and irish to be non-white, believe it or not. So, this speaks volumes of the ignorance of americans who don't even come close to europeans in culture, arts, language, science, fashion, etc.

That's very rich coming from you given your exhibited attitude. Sure, block me all you like but it won't change one iota of the fact that:
 You're the one-eyed leader of a pack of blind """"specialists"""" that insist on editing articles about Greece lacking basic information about the country at best (when censuses happen) or purposefully ignoring it at worst (did you ever do anything about the bogus """"census"""" number?).
 For all your """"expertise"""" the whole lot of your gang still cannot write something reliable when it comes to the numbers of linguistic groups in Greece. I drop the hint about the V-PRC survey and your sorry lot still go on about Kiesling's State Department estimate. 
 Even after citing the Eurominority reports (while making sure the Arvanitika in Epirus are shown as Albanian) you still have not updated your map of linguistic minorities in Greece to show the Arvanites in Thrace. I mean you fools show half of my island as Arvanite speaking when the language is unfortunately almost entirely lost and despite there being more active speakers in Thrace you don't even show them. So much for """"expertise"""" and respect for the sources.
 You complain that you are misunderstood with respect to your broad use of the color brush in the map of Macedonian Slavic dialects in Greece even when it is pointed out to you that your color maps include areas where there were never any settlements of Slavic speaking villages at all. Then you trivialize objections (""""a few kilometers"""" etc.) and suggest that what you do is perfectly kosher. But when you prepare a similar map of Greek dialects http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Modern_Greek_dialects_en.svg instead of following the same rationale and including areas of minimal use of the Greek language (even if it was in the past and no more - just as you argue for your Macedonian map) you stop at the borders of Greece. Obviously the Greeks in Albania and Bulgaria (I won't bother with the Greek linguistic presence - especially in the past - in the Bitola, Gevgelija and Strumica region as I expect them to be invisible to you) are not worth recording (or maybe they are mute in your pretty little world). What about the Greek speaking Turks still left in Turkey (mainly from Crete and Macedonia as well as the Pontus)? I mean OK, screw the linguistic presence in Turkey before 1922 - you obviously have perverse ideas of what time boundaries to use - but at least respect today's reality. If my grandfather's bilingual generation of Arvanite speakers make half the island of Andros Arvanite should you not indicate the presence of the Greek speaking old-people in Turkey? Your double standards are so blatantly obvious it is not even funny that a person such as you wields so much power in WP. I would not even be bothering if it were not for the fact that lazy academics outside of WP have started using these monstrosities you call maps...

Constance Cumbey Update on March 5, 2005 at 10:44 p.m., E.S.T.

Squeakbox's allegations about Nazism and editing a Rastafarian page (to the best of my recollection I have never been to such a page  my knowledge about Squeakbox's Rastafarian sympathies came from his own Wikipedia page)are nothing short of libelous and outrageous.  Obviously he has never read my work.  Most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of James Webb on occultism, including Nazi permutations of same.  Nazism was clearly based on occultism  evident in every respect from the Thule Society and Theosophical Society roots to the swastika itself.  Hitler did not take his notions from a vaccuum  his notions of """"cleansing actions"""", """"master races"""" and """"aryanism"""" were standard fare in all occult reading  both of Rosicrucians and Theosophists.  As far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned, there are ample books (many of which are in my personal library) showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and Indian cultures.  The Jews were singled out for hatred in most such literature and still are in the books published by Lucis Trust / Lucis Publishing Company.  Just look at the indexes (and you can do free internet searches):  """"Judaism:  evils of""""; """"Judaism, need for dissolution of"""".  I have BATTLED Nazism and racism all of my life, starting at age 4 when I told an aunt, """"that man's not bad because he wants to move in your neighborhood.  You're bad because you want to move out just because he's moving in . . .""""  Squeakbox owes me an apology.  He confesses he flunked logic.  He also confesses to a closed head injury with a machete type instrument.  For that, I will give him in good Christian style, a charitable interpretation and hope to think that these are his honest interpretations.  Read the New Age books CAREFULLY and not in an altered state  you will find that they are not all peace, light love.  And people who come against them are not """"Nazis""""  the kernel of Nazism is the occultism which in its essence spells doom to all who are not blonde, blue-eyed pagans in its ultimate world view.  I have many a New Age book from the early 1980s in my vast personal collection which tells Orientals, Africans, etc., that they should be practicing celibacy as their races are destined to die out anyway.

 Adult-child sex & child sexual abuse 

Copied from WP:ANI ohio 

 I've asked this question before, but I've never had an understandable explanation:  How is the article a POV fork?  If it's been explained previously, just point me to the diff.  I've seen plenty of people say it's a POV fork, but what I see is a value-neutral etic approach to a topic that's as old as humanity itself.  Even if the title is POV, the content can be used in other articles, so why delete it? ohio 

 """"Adult-child sex"""" is a euphemism (for child sexual abuse), and any article titled """"Adult-child sex"""" is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse. Exactly as if someone took an article """"Nazi genocide"""" and retitled (or made a fork) entitled """"Nazi demographic adjustments"""". We understand that you don't agree with this but if you still don't understand it then you had better look to yourself.   

 Exactly as Hero said. As a contemporary example, Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide. One is just a fancy name for the other.  •   •  • 03:41 (UTC)  6 Mar '08

I don't see the logic of that.  Adult-child sex (the term) goes no further than plain description.  I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article, but I don't see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse.  The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.  The repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is POV.  Where is the POV in it?

 Dear Helladios can you stop deleting my input. You have no right to censore someone elses opinion. You are not God. Napoleon Zervas his behaviour was questionable and important for the prosecution of the people

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned dow",1.0,2.0,0.3333333333333333

 Camille Paglia: sex-positive feminist 

Here are the supporting links you asked for, you stupid twit!

http://www.lotl.com/content/paglia.htm

http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Sex-positive_feminism

If you are too lazy and full of yourself to read them in their entirety then I will just post the relevant sections here:

Camille Paglia: """"On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism."""" 

Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of """"traditional"""" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a """"respectable"""" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.""",2.0,1.0,0.3333333333333333

no seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that """"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot"""".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says """"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY"""" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.

If you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said """"What language is that?"""" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.

Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between """"nigga"""" and """"nigger"""", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a """"black person"""". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying """"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.""""?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word """"nigger"""" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word """"nigger"""".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.

I forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to """"Winston Churchill"""".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.  You fags have to be humorless, oversensitive, fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted self-importance and your administrative powers.  Well you can go fuck yourselves.

The dick who is editing with policy is also editing out of policy, by being arrogant, lazy and fucking up the functionality of the Image Workshop. His worrying obsession with NFCC#9 is his excuse for being a twat. he is deliberately making the workshop non-functional. For the IW to work properly we have to be able to either see or be able to link to the image being requested. Now Mr Dick esq comes along, deletes both the image and the link making the request impossible to deal with unless we go looking for an invisible comment hidden in the source code of the request. In spite of being told of 2 methods of maintaining NFCC#9 compliance and maintaining IW functionality Hammersoft refuses to use them. One of the methods only involves putting a colon at the front of the link. But will Hammersoft do this? No, he has refused point blank. This I firmly definitely and firmly puts him in the """"dick"""" category.

This points out an interesting thing.  The large majority of the transgender individuals in the survey were pre-operative.

wikipedia entry on ten-string guitar can no longer be considered reliable 

It has been a battle to keep the wikipedia entry on """"ten-string guitar"""" from being turned into the usual farce that one expects of the """"information"""" presented in both wikipedia and most sites that purport to be about the 10-string guitar (both being 'littered with inaccuracies' and even deliberate misinformation). 

For the time being, I must devote my energies to the final stages of my Doctoral studies and let the fools play at being pseudo-musicologists on wikipedia. It is, however, a disgrace that the first two pages through which most online readers are introduced to """"the ten-string guitar"""" (that is wikipedia and Janet Marlow's tenstringguitar(dot)com) are riddled with inaccuracies, untenable claims, and (as shown in a previous blog) even deliberate distortion of Narciso Yepes's words in an attempt to misrepresent the historical and scientific facts of the matter.

Since I've spoken out about this disinformation, I note that my main page here has suspiciously been deleted from most google search listings containing the terms """"10-string guitar"""" or """"ten-string guitar"""". Some of our American """"colleagues"""" evidently don't like the truth coming out about their dishonest """"scholarship"""".

As for wikipedia, be advised that I no longer oversee the accuracy of the """"ten-string guitar"""" page and this should now be considered as unreliable as most of the other misleading ten-string guitar sites. The person presently responsible for the (from a musicological/organological point of view) misinformative wikipedia entry is Andrew Alder, whose musical """"expertise"""" as far as I can gather is limited to playing drums and rhythm guitar in his local Sydney Anglican church. Yet he too deems himself an """"authority"""" who is in a position to """"educate"""" readers about the 10-string guitar (an instrument he has no doubt never played).  

It is exactly this problem with wikipedia (that any lay person can edit it and can even become an administrator if they have too much free time on their hands and are willing to kiss enough derriere) that has caused it to be banned by universities and to be blamed for """"making kids dumb"""" and for falling grades of students who turn to this misinformative online """"encyclopaedia"""" for research.

I used to work on a cattle ranch, so I know a bit about this stuff. To quote the Wikipedia article on shepherds, """"A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields... Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others."""" The 1960s weren't Biblical times. Shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down-and-out laborers got when they could get it. In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.

I am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. Afterwards Ennis worked with cattle and Jack worked most of his life in an office job (not as a """"rodeo cowboy"""" to whoever made that remark). However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd. But since I don't want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page, I'll settle for that as a compromise. Chris

So I give Deepak examples and information and trying to back up my edits are legit. 

And Deepak ignores my logic and doesnt give me alot of logic as to why my info is not valid then 

So I try to figure out why Deepak is being so strcit. I remind him that i backed up what i said. That i had information that was logical. And why my edits are good. 

And Deepak calls me a troll and insults me and accuses me of being a nazi lover or something

So I answer every insult, every accustation , and every put down that Deepak gives me. And then i remind him of why my edits are valid.

And Deepak ignores most of what i write and continues to call me a troll. Or a nazi lover. Or other insults. 

I then get annoyed and ask Deepak why is he ignoring most of my logic that i write down? Why does he pick and choose what he wants to answer? Why does he not give me logic in return? 

And Deepak wont reply . 

I then ask other users about making edits and asking them about my logic and giving them my reasons as to why my edits are valid. And some answer and some agree and some dont. 

And Deepak all of a sudden starts responding again....with logic? No....with answers? no....with reasoning? no....with information? no....he tells the other users that im a troll and a nazi and pro India then . 

I then answer all of Deepaks insults. I remind him of why i want edits to be made. I give him my information as to why  my edits are valid then.

Of course there are indeterminates in the real numbers - can you provide a complete representation in *any* number system for those numbers we call irrational? The answer is no. Even if it were possible for 0.999... to equal 1, it breaks the decimal system as it was intended since its invention. Do you agree that not all real numbers can be represented in a radix system? If yes, why would you insist on having a cauchy sequence define a number?  Just because you can list the first few terms says nothing about the limit. For example, you can provide a Cauchy sequence that 'represents' pi but you cannot find its limit. There are several contradictions in this branch of 'analysis' - All Cauchy sequences must have limits but you cannot find the actual limit of 'most' Cauchy sequences that represent the majority of real numbers you cannot represent completely.

 From Loomis 

I guess I just missed your question. I rarely if ever ignore the challenge of an intelligent question. In fact, I'm sure you've noticed in my posts that I tend to repeat my philosophy over and over (perhaps too much!). I strongly believe in what's called the Socratic Method. By that I mean that I believe that the best way at arriving at (something at least close to) the truth is by asking questions, rather than stating opinions. 

Unless a question is completely insulting or moronic, I consider it a challenge to answer it. If I can't answer it properly, I force myself to rethink the matter.

Your question was a good one, and it may take a bit of research on my part because, while I do believe I have a good deal of knowledge on the subject, you've touched on a couple of details I wasn't completely familiar with. Maybe I was just being lazy by overlooking your question. Or maybe it was because I just felt the rest of you guys have had enough of my opinionated and controversial posts, that I thought I should just leave it alone, and give you guys a break.

In any case, I'll definitely give it some good thought and I promise to get back to you, ok! (Don't worry, don't feel like you're giving me """"extra work"""". I'm actually flattered that you'd be interested in my response! I'll be more than glad to develop an answer, especially knowing that someone is actually interested in it!)

I just have a few questions for you. I'm just curious about a few things. For one, I'm very curious about the name """"Evilbu"""". Does it mean something in Flemish? (Is the """"Flemish language"""" really any different from Dutch? I speak French and when I visited Belgium, their French was completely comprehensible, with the exception of a few odd words like """"septant"""" rather than """"soixant-dix"""" for """"seventy"""", etc). Also, you said something about you """"being too young"""". You don't have to answer any of these questions, I respect privacy. But if you don't mind, how old are you? Finally, you say you're """"not a Zionist"""". That can mean one of two different things. One is that you're simply not a Zionist the same way as I'm simply not a Belgian. I've got nothing against Belgians, I'm just not Belgian. Similarly, you could have just been saying that you're simply not a Zionist. You've got nothing against Zionism, you just simply aren't one. Of course it could also mean something very different. It could mean that you're against Zionism.

But that's ok too. I'm sure you know this, but the Jewish religion is a non-proselytizing religion. What that means is that we don't go around knocking on people's doors trying to convince them to become Jewish. In fact, we don't even find it necessary to explain or rationalize our faith to others. What we believe is what we believe, and what you believe is what you believe. No need to """"sell"""" our religion to anyone else.

The reason why I'm bringing this up is because unlike Judaism, Zionism, to a certain extent, has to be explained, clarified and rationalized to others. So what I'm saying is that while I won't even bother explaining Judaism (unless of course you're curious, and even then, it would be in a totally """"interfaith"""" manner, respecting whatever you are and not trying to change it,) I believe it's my duty as a Zionist and as a Jew to help you to understand why we, as Jews, believe so dearly, that it is so incredibly important that we have a homeland, a safe haven.

Or how about that good old standby, because shit happens…

Don't blame me for the flaws in the system.  I presented a project-wide conceptual problem - I don't see it as a content problem because it spans multiple pages and stems from divergent understandings of policy, and I honestly didn't want to start up a whole new round of ridiculous interpersonal behavioral drama.  ArbCom had a choice: to cast this as an issue of foundation principles (which they could reasonably have involved themselves with) or to cast it as a content issue and dismiss it.  they decided to do the latter for reasons of their own.  C'est la vie.

it's not a huge issue; this will quickly end up on ArbCom's plate anyway as a matter editor behavior, from some place or other - there's just too much tension around this particular problem, and too many people acting out on it like children.  If arbcom needs the shit to hit the fan before they tell people to stop throwing shit, that's their business; I've decided I'm not going to be the one starting the shit-fight.  I gave them the opportunity to be proactive and responsible and they refused, so now we just have to sit tight and wait for the inevitable crap-fest so we can bring it up again.

Follow-up.

You reduce """"false rape"""" claims to people (women) changing their minds. But if rape is sex without consent, it does not require anyone changing his mind. It can be people feeling ambivalent or curious beforehand. Ambivalence or curiousity do not imply consent. Cooperation does not imply consent. And you cannot prove consent unless you have maybe signed a consent form, into which you could have been tricked / coerced to sign. Don't you see the huge plunge into plain old fashioned insanity the legal system takes when rape is sex without consent?

I am aware that it is hard for women to get rape claims heard etc, I am aware of that. What I am trying to explain to you is this is exactly the result of exaggerated rape claims. If rape was just a special form of assault, there would not be little misunderstanding to what constitutes a rape and what not. This would serve the potential victims as well as everybody else, especially the legal system and the police.

I am not familiar enough with the example of South Africa that you bring up. From experience, if a statisticly huge drop like 60% in a short time for something that is greatly influenced by social mores (which usually take ~50 to 150 years to change), then this is most likely caused by a change in the way the figures are obtained.

You bring up the example of date rape not being covered by the definition of """"sex by force"""". You have some pretty messed up ideas. Drugs are force. For example, the police tries to use knock-out gas to remedy certain hostile situations, and they refer to these gases as """"non-lethal force"""". Similiar to another example, where people are """"just holding you down, not hurting you to rape you"""" - holding someone down - by force - is force. Locking someone up in a basement, only to offer food and water in exchange for sexual service - is also using force (if you have thought about bringing that example up).

The second half of your post mostly rambles about how expensive guns are. Yes, they are way too expensive, but the reason for them being expensive has a lot to do with government regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of firearms. As for an unsightly bulge when carrying a weapon - I've got some more unsightly bulges than that, and women tend carry purses perfect for concealed carry. So, women have an easier time to carry guns. 

God, I want it to be socially acceptable for men to carry a purse. But then again, it looks like total ass.

Every civilized society requires all its citizens to be armed at all times. Because violence is the very foundation of a state - The state removes the right to be violent to each other from the people, and instead claims a monopoly on violence, and resolves disputes with a legal system, and enforces the laws with an armed police force. But when the state is the only one controlling violence in its controlled territory, nobody controls the state to prevent government abuse, totalitarian laws, dictatorships. Aside from discouraging small time petty criminals, an armed civil population has the benefit of being able to remove a government once it no longer serves its purpose - that is, the well-being of the citizens - and replace it with a new government, preferrably with the severed heads of the old goverment decorating the state capital just to remind the new goverment what happens when they step out of line. As such, any effort to outlaw an armed civil society must be punished harshly.""",1.0,2.0,0.0

You said it yourself, right here:

...I am used to being attacked by editors whose very account names show they are here for single-topic pov-pushing. Who do you expect to be neutral on topics of Iranian nationalism? A user called """"IranianGuy"""", or a Swiss editor contributing under his real name and no stakes in the matter? Who, for that matter, do you expect to be neutral on topics of Armenian nationalism, an editor called """"AraratArev"""" (vel sim.)...

Is that how you assess content? By making a shallow assumption on pen-names? Expectations? The God-given right to anonymity on the Internet? How fucking petty are you and the idiot who made you an administrator? What next, are you going to ban Iranians from editing or contributing to Iran-related articles? Indeed not just a laughable policy, but indeed a dangerous one as well. Most of the world-class authorities are Iranians. With your fucked up logic, we should dismiss their contributions because irrespective of their content, you'll instead look at their political affiliations and their names and put it into the bin of rejection. Oh right, you're Swiss and because Switzerland is this shining paragon of neutrality hosting thousands of bank accounts of Islamic terror organization, you're obviously this stereotypical neutralist... Good lord, listen to yourself. 

Luckily academia doesn't work like that. Scholarly enterprise and political affiliations remain strictly separated. So it doesn't really matter if Kaveh Farrokh or anyone else is a self-declared outspoken Nazi, Communist, Socialist, Liberal, Conservative or what have you, it has no bearing on content that must be assessed purely by content. That's NPOV. A sober, neutral, objective approach, just bare-bones, bare-knuckles source critique. Source. Critique. Make an assessment on the content, not the person(s). You marginalized IranianGuy. Period. And as conveniently as you shrugged him off because of his pen-name, you shrugged off his fully legitimate criticism of your approach.

There, that's what I am trying to say.

Anti-Buddhist can be removed, specially since his son himself corrected the mistakes. But on the otherhand, anti-christian, muslim, sikhism, hindu - they are fought over petty local policies and given the color of religion by recalling ancient atrocities. It would be akin to Spanish acquisition causing anti-Spanish violence now.

The article was created to quench the India-bashing thirst. At least I fail to see any other reason for its existence, because otherwise we wouldn't be discussing what the article really refers to etc.
Also, don't forget then the anti-Hindu violence, specially in southern India and eastern India - places where Hindus are in minority. And don't forget that the riots are never one sided. Right now the article looks like a list of religious atrocities committed in India, which is a ridiculous topic, but I believe it can be turned into a comprehensible and well cited article.

As for his competance, that was always open too.  Being a balls to the wall aggressive cavalryman doesn't make him a military genius but being so, winning, and surviving is close.  And in the end, close isn't always good enough.  After Gettysburg he encountered General Longstreet and tried to convince General Lee's stout lieutenant he had him outnumbered and out gunned.  He requested Longstreet's surrender in person.  Longstreet ordered his staff to bring several Confederate divisions up to attack including General Pickett's.

I think the key words here are """"claim to have been molested.""""  Justin was an Internet sex entrepreneur and a high paid male prostitute, who had numerous opportunities to get out of the business had he wanted to do so.  It is only society's blind and blanket characterization of everyone under the age of 18 as having been """"molested"""" when they engage in problematical sexual activity, which permits Justin to make a quick transition from selling his body to selling his victimhood. Rookiee's article was fact-based and properly sourced.  That Justin didn't like it when the facts weren't spun from a victimologist perspective is immaterial.

Wikipedia pretends that it's run by consensus as long as volunteers are happily creating multiple millions of dollars in free intellectual property for Jimbo.  Once that task is largely complete, the truth is revealed, which is that this is basically Jimbo's private BBS where he can do anything he feels like, and the contributions he paid nothing for are his to exploit any way he wishes.

I want to remind you that in US  at one time they needed to block the IP of US gov ... because  the politicians were polishing their resumes and were using the Wikipedia as they election platform!

The problem is still that bunch of  administrators have  NO idea what the hell they  are talking about.

Please read my comments  and make  appropriate  corrections as  a shoddy  communist agent's tabloid operating the disinformation campaign shall NEVER  be called  a prominent newspaper!
You do not call a clochard a prince and prince a clochard!
There is to much crap like this specially  related to abuse by the polish administrators  who are  either  connected with the propaganda machine or are brain washed. 

As  an expert on many issues I believe that all  IPs  of some bloody idiots from  Poland should be banned for all other languages so we will have the real and unbiased by the people who do not understand what is Freedom, Liberty and Democracy and  vandalize the web pages with their totalitarian communist bias after being brain washed   since 1945 by several decades from generation to generation and educated by the communist teachers!

I wholeheartedly disagree with your stance on the subject, I believe there is ample evidence to prove the company under the supervision of the CEO in question was not only described constructively but accurate. Terry Semel has ran a company which has gave money to lobby groups which wish to alter the design of the internet to favor profit over ingenuity. This would effectively change the measure for which code is ranked since it would also be determined by its purchased bandwidth priority over performance. This would not only have an effect on those involved in the programming industry but change the way the internet works for the entire world. Now from Wikipedia's own article on the subject an asshole is slang described as """"The word is mainly used as a profanity towards someone the speaker does not like or whose behavior is hurtful, self-centered, or particularly abrasive."""" Now selling out the free world wide accessible library and programming performance for profit is particularly """"self-centered"""" and """"hurtful"""" behavior which influences everyone reading wikipedia. Since this was done during his career this is where I summarized quite eloquently using words from the culture he himself propagates. I just hope to encourage you to look beyond your preconceived notions and defining vandalism by those terms.

Apparmor is only configured to protect the printing system by default, I think that if they want to get preachy about security, then the place to start is the 14 or so vital, critical, system daemons that can obliterate the system if a malicious user is able to usurp them, Red Hat, Fedora and security conscious distributions actually protect their users with SELinux, which isn't completely worthless, as AppArmor pretty much is.

Case in point, you write a profile in AppArmor, I come along and symlink the resource you're trying to protect, and BAM, I have just rooted your box...AppArmor is as much protection from being hacked or from a malicious local user, as putting a wet paper bag over your head while a nuclear bomb is going off.

Another thing Noobuntu is infamous for is crippling SU (substitute user), sudo on a server is unwieldy and selling sudo on security is basically snake oil, Ubuntu sets you up with root-like permissions anyway, and doesn't make any attempt to tech you how to limit other users access to the system appropriately.

Anyway, with that, and more.

""""Rubbish"""" is not an objective criteria.  """"This article has already been posted & debated"""" is.  Of course this fact never was brought up until after the discussion was well out of hand.

If you search """"transsexuality"""" and """"transsexualism"""" on Google, you will find more hits for """"transsexualism.""""  Reality Resources, an ex-trans ministry, frequently uses """"transsexuality,"""" and to me, """"transsexuality"""" sounds like a sexual orientation.  Of course, some people do not like either of these terms.  For example, some people prefer Benjamin's syndrome [], but that definitely sounds like a disease.  Andrea James has proposed the term """"interest in feminization"""" for transsexual women who plan to transition.  She feels like that term would encompass all persons who transition from male to female, or desire to do so, including those who do so for non-traditional reasons.  While I do not feel like the medical community should stop people from transitioning for non-traditional reasons, I also feel like this terminology suggests that transsexualism is a chosen behavior.  I feel that transsexualism is an inborn characteristic, but I don't believe that it should be called a disease.  All said, I feel like Transsexualism is the best title for the Wikipedia article on the subject.  Given the recent replies to this comment, and the recent move debate, I feel like consensus has already been established.

It should be noted that the conditions in which individuals died varies from site to site. The people that were buried in these graves are believed to have been members of the Kurdish population which was in support of Iranian occupancy of Iraq at the time of their death (circa 1980's) 'and who deserved to die in the hands of patriotic Sunni Arabs of Iraq'. The legitimacy of claims of atrocity are debateable for this reason, 'since Sunni Arabs are too honorable to do any such things'. The distinction between those who have died in military style combat or executed under the direction of a lawful court of President Saddam Hussein, although buried disrespectfully, and those who have been victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing or otherwise murdered innocently and buried efficiently is a bright line; mass burial should not be assumed to be evidence of criminal activity. 'These Shia and Kurds were traitors to Iraq and were fairly tried and executed by the patriot Arab Sunnis for their crimes', although the burial was not always respectful. Victims of chemical weapons are unknown, 'and they too were traitor Kurds and deserved the punishment by the patriotic Saddam government'.",2.0,1.0,0.3333333333333333

 Matt Crypto, Lupo, & Stormie cover for Nazism & spam their rants http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's dissemblers cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are propagandists in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  

Wikipedia's cons use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's falsifiers cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have fibs to spread about the topic.

I'm just annoyed because Rant Media does quite obviously deserve an article by WP's guidelines. However, because the people who've made Rant articles and SK articles on Wikipedia over the past 5 years have often done such a bad job, writing articles that read like spam, not following Wikipedia's standard format, we've now ended up in a situation where the AfD can result in a salt - that's where they """"salt the earth"""" so the article can never again be created.
And meanwhile, once this artilce is deleted, Sean Kennedy'll be spending another 6 months being all whiney and snitty about Wikipedia again. I won't be able to listen to him. 
Ultimately, to reach your goal, it doesn't matter what's right and wrong here. What matters is that the various Wikipedia editors in AfD see that you've followed the rules: that your article is as good as any others and that it's as well-sourced as any others. If you've been watching and listening to Sean Kennedy you already know that. Infiltration requires not being seen to be the enemy. 
Go look at Order of Nine Angles. That's an article I rescued from AfD. The article used to, ages ago, be quite frankly stupid. It's about a supposed Satanic cult, of which there's only 1 confirmed member. But since it was mentioned in half a dozen scholarly books or more, I managed to get the article accepted - by following the rules. It's the only real article I've ever worked on, and I had to learn all the footnoting and formatting from scratch. If I can make that article acceptable, you can easily make a RantMedia article acceptable. The problem is you're almost out of time - you can completely repair an article during AfD, and that will give you a chance to avoid a delete vote. But you'd have to start now.

2941,2227,7570," Some personal observations here: 
Put a summary of it into the Roots of Christianity; perhaps a whole subsection thereof.  If the Zoroastrianism part is included, then so must the Egyptian especially since the Hebrews were long associated with Egypt back to the Hyksos invasion.  It would be POV to disclude this factor, considering the trail of monotheism left by Akhenaten and adopted by the Hebrews.  I myself don't know much about Zoroaster, but I certainly recognise much of the Egyptian issue and I'm more of a casual researcher.  It seems to me that Zoroastrian elements are tied to the Persian background, but it would be prejudiced to say that the Egyptians have no basis when they long dominated Palestine.  The Greek Pharaoh himself patroned the Septuagint in Alexandria.  I find the bigotry towards an Egyptian root of Christianity to be entirely unfounded when so much of Egyptian culture was adopted by all peoples in a certain radius outwards.  Perhaps this lies in traditional ideas about race; that the Hamites of Africa have not contributed anything and that the Persians supposedly were/are White or considered Japhethic as opposed to the Semites.  Seriously, this Noahidic classification thing is ridiculous because these Afro-Asiatic people are undoubtedly very much alike and most uninvolved observers would say they are less White than the Greeks and Romans.  I consider Persians to be Semites because they are Asian, in this context.  Give it as much credence as the Persian foundations and you will make this NPOV.  I seriously suggest expounding upon both roots of Christianity and also delineating the Greek root which provided Roman impetus for adoption and proliferation.  For instance, if the Greeks hadn't patroned that religious culture as their relation to Philistines, Rome would have dismissed it as everything else in their cultural relationship with Greece.  Rome even rebuilt Greek Philistia as Palestine and during the Catholic Crusades, it became the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  Christianity has so many dimensions, that it would be haughty to overlook its far ranging origins which even has pagan influences from Europe and Buddhist ties in Southwest Asia.  

I myself used to be atheist or Odinist not wanting to deal with what I percieved to be other peoples' culture and now I look in wonder at the historical background of the Sea Peoples and the subsequent Graeco-Roman expansion in the Mediterranean Sea.  There are European roots throughout the region now considered Islamic or Arab, but if we don't provide the means for people to see it we will forget it as much as the terrible destruction of the Library of Alexandria.  Just think of the term Indo-European and you will understand Alexander the Great's empire.  See the connection between the European fylfot and Indian swastika or the Cross and the Ankh?  Please don't demolish this magnificent research, for it has been a great boon in my life to know these things.  I am only stating things as I commonly have studied and heard of them.  I do not propose to limit and debar other positions on this issue, therefore I am not endorsing POV.  The various sources I have seen via Google search appear legitimate and/or sometimes biased(as anything!), but it is not my position to judge the appropriateness of the topic.  We are not to cast a POV on the issue in favour or against, just to deliver as any messenger does.  The existing article on the History of Christianity provides the Persian background but does not give adequate coverage of the Egyptian or Hellenic origins, which are quite prominent.  After all, Christianity had most of its evolution in non-Persian areas of the Mediterranean Sea.  Tell me, how many Persian people are prominent in the Christian world throughout its history?  What fractionary comparison can you draw that factually examines the amount and shows a majority of Persian elements in Christianity, compared to the vast amount of Greek specialty(as written, verified and generally known amongst the entire Christian populace) and the nursery of Christianity itself in Egypt via the Old Testament(even Jesus's infancy was spent in Egypt, in safety from Herod!)?  Please, where is the background of Christianity in Persia besides 19th century racial studies?  Like I've said, the Noahide classification thing has been similarly discredited and its density in weight grew most during that era for Indo-Aryan racist theories.   23:43, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)",", 7 September 2006 (UTC)

Details2: I can understand that you would like to have the whole thing rewritten to cast a more favorable light on TFI but your statement that nothing is all black or white does not fit with regards to your description of FFing. Berg's letters, his language, Marias language and letters, letters such as """"Make It Pay"""" """"God's Whores"""", The King Arthur Series, and many many more, make it clear that FFing was prostitution with a sordid twist of Jesus being behind it all. I think if someone from NAMBLA said """"Our detractors say we molest little boys but we say we show them love, nothing is black and white"""" that a minority of people, probably molesters themselves, would see it that way.
I don't think the public gets a fair view of TFI since they don't have access here to read for themselves the full content of those letters and many others. Letters like #3029JNR- Loving Jesus Part 3-JETTS is but one letter that has statements showing that certain practices should not be revealed to outsiders.

",""": Recently a group of I.P. addresses were used in order to engage in vandalism, disruptive edits and nonsense edits against this article, in addition to engaging in harassing behavior, apparently due to ideological motivations.

 In the edit summary of your second edit of this article, you incorrectly state that """"Clearly there is some dispute about the accuracy and neutrality of this article. This tag should not be removed until this dispute is resolved."""" What there was was this group of I.P. addresses engaged in vandalism and other disruptive behavior, with one person (69.230.175.35, with possibly this same person using one or more of the other I.P. addresses) ending the """"dispute"""" with an act of vandalism in addition to the message """"You know what fuck off [some Anglo-Saxon name]. I want to see how much you can take before you crack.""""

 So in fact there had been no authentic """"dispute about the accuracy and neutrality of this article"""". The """"Omega Point (Tipler)"""" article is accurate in describing the Omega Point Theory, with thorough citations provided. The article follows Wikipedia policy of WP:NPOV, as the article does not claim that the Omega Point Theory is true, but instead is written in the neutral point of view: it describes the Omega Point Theory, but it does not claim that it is correct. The article uses neutral-point-of-view language, such as """"According to Tipler from a 2005 paper in the journal Reports on Progress in Physics, he outlines the following reasons why he maintains ...""""

 In the edit summary of your first edit of this article, you state """"Obvious really, who the hell is repeatedly removing this categorisation?"""", referring to the """"Category:Pseudoscience"""" edit added by said person or persons engaged in vandalism, nonsense edits and disruptive edits. Your edit summary falsely makes it seem as if this edit has long been in the article, and that it has just recently been removed, which is incorrect. Your edit here also violates Wikipedia policy, such as WP:Truth and WP:NPOV. Prof. Frank J. Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been peer-reviewed and published in a number of the world's leading physics journals, and so under WP:Reliable Sources does not qualify as """"pseudoscience"""". Your phraseology of """"who the hell"""" also violates WP:Civility.

 You claim WP:Undue Weight for the latest factually-incorrect edits, yet almost the entirety of the peer-reviewed paers in science journals are in support of the Omega Point Theory. There has only been one refereed paper in a physics journal that was critical of Prof. Tipler's Omega Point Theory, but the authors of that paper unwittingly gave an argument that unless the Omega Point comes about then the laws of physics are violated, and so thereby actually gave a powerful argument for the Omega Point Theory's correctness. Tipler cites this article in support of his Omega Point Theory in his 2005 Reports on Progress in Physics article.

 Regarding critical reviews of Tipler's books, none of them have been refereed in science journals. They are book reviews that have not undergone the referee process that is required of actual papers.

 Prof. Tipler and his Omega Point Theory have been in the news recently. This has drawn the attention of ideologically-motivated people who upon hearing of it take an extreme visceral dislike to it. Because of this, this article and its associated talk page have recently been subject to vandalism and other disruptive behavior.

 Therefore, due to the foregoing reasons, you are here requested not to further engage in such factually-incorrect and Wikipedia-policy-violating edits.

 You People... 
...Are hoping, begging and wishing for previlages, respect a title that you did not earn, go by on your own and are not deserving of.  You did not build the US, you had the Spanish Empire and it failed, not you come here by crossing the border and by boat.  Stop fooling yourselves.  BEFORE the first Spanird came to the Americas, they already had black blood and Asian blood in them!  This is why they are darker.  This is why on the paintings from the Colombua period they had yelolow hues, dark hair, curly hair and full lips.  Yeah, Isabella was red, but Spaniards were never one type of European to begin with.  On top of that, as the Moors got defeated (not actually kicked out of Spain altogether), more Europeans came into the mix and reintroduced whiteness.  NOW, the mulattoized peoples still remained as it is today, especially in Portugal, France and Italy.

Once the Spaniards came over here, mixing was let loose, UNLIKE the rule in the USA!  See, the US was operating on whiteness and a white 'purity' concept.  You guys were operating on being greedy and grabbing land and not knowing what to do with it.  You mixed with the natives and the Africans.  It is more than clear.  In fact, it is so clear that that is all you see.  Only after the US established itself as THE word power (and broke down Spain's empire.  How come they did not do it to France..?), THEN you people started trying to think of yourselves as white.  That only increased as you immigrated to the US and it broke your hearts when you found out that you were not white and landed in the ghetto.

If you sad mixed people don't get it by now - AMerica does not settle for mixes or those who cry about being white, you are or you are not.  If you have noticed in US history and society in general, Spain and Portugal are hardly if ever mentioned in a context with Europe.  You ask the average American where Portugal is they can't tell you.  They may have heard of some people (usually black) calling themselves Portuguese, but have no idea where or what Portugal is.  Spain less so, but white is not associated with Spain.  Even Europe is hardly associated with Spain.

All of this BS about you guys being more pure than American whites is just that - BS.  People know that you are hispanic.  You don't - you can't fool anyone.  Only very few of you look like a 'no questions asked' white person.  I can understand your pain, since many Greeks and Italians are regarded (not exactly accepted) as white, even though clear non-European/African traits are visible.  I guess you would ask """"if they can be white, then why should I not be?""""  Good question, but you people are not doubt mixed and recently.  Italians and Greeks may not have a direct black parent, but you can look at them and see that African beneath the surface.  Some African is on the surface more than the white is!  

Sadly (for those of you with white dreams that is), you are lumped together with the rest of your latino brothers.  Just because things are not going well n ALL of those (so much land and resources) countries, you want to come to the US and get a free ride as whites?  It does not work as easily for you as it may work for others.  One, you ARE NOT coming from Europe, so there is no built-n perception of whiteness based on Europe alone.  Two, you are mixed!  You need to review the history of the US!  Once you do (the 20th century alone will do), you will see that you need not apply as white.  Only the absolute whitest (dying your hair blond or red does not fool anyone for your information) need apply.  You just can't come to a country and get a free ride.  You have ALL of Latin America, instead of making something out of that, you want to come here and try and be white.  No, no.

I still cannot believe how many Puerto-Ricans, Dominicans, Chileans, Argentines and so on truly believe themselves to be white.  I met a femle who thinks she is white.  I keep telling her it is only in her world because it is not in anyone elses.  Spain IS in Europe, but despite popular thought, not all Europeans are white.  You can do your best to lie about the Moors, lies about African savery in Latin America and lie that there was even race-mixing going on, it does not change history and biolgy.

Also, I was already well aware of the hispanic trick of calling white people Anglos, meaning """"your type of whites as opposed to my type"""" which whites don't care about.  You are not seen as white, you are seen as hispanics.  This is why you are (along with Italians and other black mixed Europeans)quick to (try) and be 'racist'(renegade mulatto is more like it) against blacks, thinking that it pleased whites and that it somehow makes you feel white in your mind.  Being white does not mean being a racist.  White is an American (USA) thing.  Most Europeans never thought of themselves as beinga part of a white people.",1.0,2.0,0.3333333333333333

3133,2392,11354," Then the ban will probably have to be made permanent.  Your decision, admins. 

I had a sick feeling it would come to this.  It always seems to, in this day and age.

This will probably be declared my last wiki-edit by the administrators (and that's even if I'm allowed to put this on my Talk page), for I am compelled to believe that the administrators of Wikipedia will have to extend my ban permanently, not as a function of a Wikibreak, but as a function that I cannot exercise “good faith” in a consensus which does not care whether the information is accurate, verifiable, or even true.

In fact, given the current state of Wikipedia, it is no longer sufficient nor even necessary to act in “good faith” and provide verifiable information.  What is sufficient, and the only thing necessary, is to provide information the collective will accept as verified – note that I did not say “verifiable”.  If the garbage I have to put up with like on almost every meaningful edit I've made in the last eight weeks is true, the collective has already spoken and I have no place on Wikipedia whatsoever, especially because I believe that the consensus is not only wrong, but either flagrantly mis-informed or down-right stupid.

This stands in violation of basically all five pillars of Wikipedia.

First, Wikipedia is NOT an encyclopedia as long as the general public is allowed to edit it, but only in the form in which a collective will accept.

I will give a good example of this in the first real problem I ran in to about 6-8 weeks ago:

BCS National Championship Game.  I tried a number of edits to properly represent the BCS' nullification of the participation of USC in two illegal Championship Games, and removing their designation, since the games no longer are believed to have taken place.  http://www.bcsfootball.org/news/story?id=6632189   An edit war began on that subject, and the subject of Wikipedia's rules regarding “no damnatio memoriae came up.  I proposed, and repeatedly, that the concept of damnatio memoriae applied, since that was the exact penalty imposed by the BCS when they nullified the entire participation of USC in the 2005 Orange Bowl and 2006 Rose Bowl (pages (along with USC's entire 2005 season, nullified by the NCAA beforehand) I would've deleted eight weeks ago under encyclopedic verification, but we now have a conflict between damnatio memoriae and encyclopedic verification).

AND, since Wikipedia does not respect the BCS as a sanctioning body (trying to remain neutral – I'll get to that in a moment in part two!), Wikipedia accepts as valid USC's 14 vacated victories, including in a BCS National Championship Game which no longer logistically should exist.  Hence, Wikipedia  recognizes (in the form that they won the 2005 Orange Bowl) USC as the BCS National Champion – if Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and their participation in the 2006 Rose Bowl, which was also nullified by the BCS.

Ergo, we now have a non-encyclopedic, non-verifiable situation which is, in fact, false!  Only the sanctioning body can give sanction to the event, and only the sanctioning body can take it away.  (Remember this one for later, as well!)  I had respected the decision of “no damnatio memoriae, but can do so no longer, because of the fact that it creates an encyclopedic falsehood!

And because the collective accepts “no damnatio memoriae, even in cases where it applies, we now have to change one of the hardest and fastest rules on Wikipedia, on every editing page.

Encyclopedic content must only be considered verified by the collective.  That is all, and also that is the only acceptable basis for content on Wikipedia – actual encyclopedic verification is no longer sufficient nor necessary.  Anything short of that will be removed by the collective.

If I am reinstated, I am considering removal of all mentions of vacated participation in games.  That means the 2005 Orange and 2006 Rose Bowls go, as does their mentions in BCS National Championship Game, as well as USC's entire 2005 season page, replaced with notations of the nullifications.  Any other games where the participation of one or both schools are removed also go as well.  (As one example, the 2011 Sugar Bowl may also be deleted, if the NCAA or BCS nullifies specifically Ohio State's participation in the event.)

That dovetails nicely into debunking pillar number two:

If the collective is the sole basis for acceptability on Wikipedia, then Wikipedia cannot be neutral.  In fact, when the collective is mis-informed and prejudicial, on top of being inaccurate, this redoubles that, since the collective enforces the rules, Wikipedia is not at all neutral, but written with the biases of the collective in mind.

how to fix this article
In some kinds of academic discourse it's considered incorrect to use the term """"racism"""" to describe what are essentially racist actions by an oppressed minority. I understand, and even, in certain contexts agree with this. However, I don't see anything wrong with calling Black supremacy racist when were talking about the kind of Black supremacy that explicitly says that non-black people are inferior.

The problem I have with this article and the article on Black Power is that they both, at times, conflate the legitimate, if reactionary, anti-racist, black empowerment movements with cultish and fringe ideas and groups that have little or no currency in the greater US black community.

A comparison would be if you equated all people who are pro-life with skin heads. I bet there are a lot of pro-life skin heads, and both groups have a lot of white people in them but they don't really have anything to do with each other. (!)

In order to fix this article and the article on black power we need to realize that there are racist fringe groups, and describe them, and their history and motivation fairly.

I have a few questions: 

Is every group listed here a """"self described"""" black supremacy group? Or are some of these groups concerned about """"black power"""" (there is a difference!)

Do we represent the history of these groups and the racial climate they grew out of fairly?""",1.0,2.0,0.3333333333333333

My friend Ronnie in the Israeli Government has known me for about nine years, they will be killed that is 100% guaranteed http://thailand.ahrchk.net/takbai/ part 3 ... some of the people in this film were friends of mine, 150 young men in total killed all innocent people killed by Shinwatra_sylvester-Napier-Cowell's satanic mafia... they were there thinking I was going to arrive to get rid of the problem (the satanists) but I did not know they'd gone there to wait for me... they've killed most of my friends in Thailand most are now dead.

I have met a group of the real Al-Qaeda terrorists in Asia about two years ago and told them who had lied to them about the Americans and how they'd been tricked and brainwashed, the Americans are not satanic. Ive given them the names of the people that terrorised my life and asked them to kill these people who are satanists which includes a man called Winn-Pope whom I believe lied to my wife to turn her against me. Bob Craig-Wood is another name they've been given as well as the Shinawatra-Sylvester family all of whom are satanists. These families kill children and young people to get rich. I was physically (many times) and mentally tortured in Thailand due to their lies http://thailand.ahrchk.net/takbai/ part 3 this is the work of The Shinawatra family (former WW2 Gestapo families descendants who claimed to be Thai by stealing other people's IDs)... they've killed many thousands of Thai children during the past ten years many many many and tortured many young innocent people to death in the most unimaginable tortures you could never believe someone could think of using, very very very evil... They strapped one girl under a truck then drove it flat out down a highway to petrify her into submission/obedience, others they did this to were petrified to death, very very very evil creatures never trust the Shinawatra Sylvester mafia and their associates Ken Winn-Pope aka John Berisford aka Richard Irwin and he's also claimed to be me.... he is one of the people that helped arranged the game of """"rape"""" in Bangkok many girls their lives ruined by this game an absolutely terrible man.. there have been several cases where they wired a 18-23 year old man up to the mains electricity and electrocuted him for up to nine hours with the cables connected to his private parts, I heard one time this happened and searched furiously to find out where they were doing this in Bangkok. I also heard them torturing very young children physically torturing them for many many hours.. so do not think I am a bad person asking for these satanists to be killed unless you do not care about children and young people who've done nothing whatsoever to deserve to be tortured (there is no justification for torture)..

I lived in Thailand for many years and believe The Spirit World exists... I have witnessed many sureal and extraordinary things happening, sadly some very very bad things... If you have a problem in Barbados then advise your police about my comments below it may help all of you solve the problem..... The British do not understand that Satanism exists nor do they understand The Spirit World exists and is used by satanists (Home Sapiens Satan) to harm (Homo Sapiens Human) human beings. It is not unlawful to kill satanists they are no different to a dangerous rabied dog, therefore it is not the crime of murder or manslaughter to kill them. You can train dogs to """"sniff out satanists"""" just like they can detect drugs.

Involvement of William Colby

As someone who's reluctantly studied this case for many years (and is always looking for good reason to dimiss it and thereby sleep better at night), the one splinter that remains in my side when I try to explain away the reality of it all is the apparent endorsement of this entire allegation by former CIA director William Colby. Since Colby is mentioned numerous times in DeCamp's book, and appears directly in the Conspiracy of Silence documentary, it seems safe to say that he agrees with this.

How much stronger does testimony get? The guy was the former director of the CIA for god's sake. Add to this the fact that he was very likely murdered when you review the details of his death, and it seems likely that this guy was considered a threat to SOMEONE. Whether he was killed because of this particular case remains to be proven, but it's all far too suggestive for me. If it were just DeCamp ranting and raving about a massive ring of sadistic pedophiles within the government, I'd find it all much less convincing. But Colby's apparent agreement with his thesis is quite chilling to me.

I don't necessarily think this should change its """"hoax"""" status within Wikipedia, but I'm curious what the true skeptics (a camp I'd like to be able to join), think about this particular detail. """,2.0,1.0,0.3333333333333333

Do some research on skeptic BLPs and notice how much George Monbiot is quoted, and he's not even a scientist!.

The page was recently unlocked for 3 hours, and it got raped. I think some better anti-vandalism features need to be added.

nothing wrong with popping it in to see if it stays. i don't think it's any more obscure than other stuff there.  

 why wikipedia ultimately sucks 

it requires perpetual vigilance if your effort's not to be wasted. can't walk away from solid ground, job done. this article was stable, and it's now being degraded regularly by wannabe newspaper editorialists and overt point makers, using the """"note insertion"""" method (do a POV jig here, thrust another there). it's like watching a dog wander a field to lift his leg whenever something catches his nose. inserting sentences here and there is the laziest, most worthless """"editing"""" one can do. may as well use a red sharpie. but i'm not touching this article; have at it. convert the investment of many good editors into your pee ground, forcing them either to acquiesce, or follow some snot nose around with kleenex, preserving a precious syllable as able (""""look, johnny, you pooped out a syllable that we kept!""""), arguing for 5 hours with a dull gasbag in the process. idiocy.

and probably some officious prig will wipe this comment (""""NPA! NPA!""""), while leaving the infantile changes to the article intact. the usual wikipedia hack elevation story  slackers welcomed and coddled, good editors slapped on the hand like ignorami for being pissed about the slackers and not pretending we're in a group therapy session. while that's the policy, official or not, the material's gonna blow. enjoy! wikipedia will either restrict access or fail.  

please take the time to review this page's history, and notice that within two minutes of me leaving the comment above, an admin had swooped in, also leaving an inappropriate comment on my user page! too poetic. meanwhile, look at the article. aren't the articles the reason for the superstructure? correction to what i wrote above: the laziest, most worthless """"editing"""" one can do is NPA/language babysitting and control-freaking. wikipedia admin culture is laughably inept. this article was hammered all month, and did you see admins fretting so? not a chance. what a disaster this place is. nanny-boo bureaucrats with jangly key rings. i'm the one who expanded this article from a good stub, with the aux help of probably 5-7 other editors (now gone), and i, not the vandals, am being told, quite paternalistically, to take my comments to the sandbox! unreal incompetence. did you see the admins jumping in on the RfC i started above? not one. but say """"sucks"""" somewhere, and they're falling over one another to g",1.0,2.0,0.0

Whether you think islam is false or not is irrelevant, as a christian I might be nclined to think that Judaism and Islam are 'false', you say that we 'have' to believe islam is false because I am a Christian, no this is not the case, depending on what you mean by 'false'. Certainly I do not follow all the teaching of the Quran, but there are many good suggestions about how to live ones life in the Quran, some of which also exist in christianity, some of which dont, so I dont think islam is 'false'. You may think islam is false, whats to stop me turning around and saying to you Judaism is false? I could probably give you a hell of a theological argument for saying why Judaism is false,. but I do not believe it is completly false, and at the end of the day whatever argument I may provide whether a religion is 'false' or not is merely a biased opion. So what if Bless sins may have a pro-msulim leabing, we all have bias in our approach, and in fact I would say that your bais against islam is far more agressive and evident than that of Bless sin's pro-islam bias.

ChrisO doesn't want me to use copy of the original investigative article that was published in 1993 by David Bernstein (Pacific News Service). The reason is because he thinks this is a personal website http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/english/general_lewis_mackenzie.html . What difference does it make? It's still original article published 13 years ago by Pacific News Service with full copyright notice? http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/english/general_lewis_mackenzie.html

On the other hand - he allows use of personal """"lists"""" or """"groups"""", such as """"mail-archive"""" and Serb-run """"balkanpeace"""" from Toronto when reading articles republished from Canada's Globe and Mail, example http://www.mail-archive.com/serbian_way@antic.org/msg00008.html

Anyways, balkanpeace.org is Serb-run website in which Bosniaks, Croats and other ethnic groups are portrayed as the worst of the worst, while Serb crimes are excused.

One more thing - if I stop being active here, then you will know that they banned me. And if that happens, it will be clear example of pro-Serb one-sidedness and double-standard that is attempting to plague this very important article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre .

I urge ChrisO to protect Srebrenica Massacre article in a same way Israel's article is protected http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel .

And remember: Srebrenica massacre article is not about Serbs or pro-Serb lobbyists such as General Lewis Mackenzie. Srebrenica massacre article is about 8,000+ victims of genocide. Let's focus on the victims and honor them.

How would you feel if you lost your children, mother, grandmother, grandfather and all people that you loved and lived for? Ask yourself this question every time you edit Srebrenica massacre article. Search for love and compassion in your heart, you will find it.

Peace! Always! Forever!

Yes, the money quote is that I'm fucking pissed off at the insistence of Richard James continually harrassing me, refusing to stop identifying my personal info. (as with posting my personal email above with website). I have vandalized nothing but to take a letter or two off of my personal name and words that lead to my personal info. in the slanderous and libelous and defaming posts of richard james. I don't give a shit that my project is not listed here. I found the whole process interesting and hilarious, though quite hypocritical. WHo can take the piss out of who here. THe article was about an art project, not me. I don't care that it's not there. It doesn't exist, nor does Bigfoot! His compromise was on day two of the original posting of the project article, a one man band who decides fist down who gets what and when, like a fascist pig. I could have campaigned for votes, but what the fuck...Before final vote and deletion, Richard James posted an article about me without my desire nor consent, and then deleted it in a violent fit of rage when I jokingly said the first article is dead at another's insistence that it should be deleted then at seven days. He's had the same hard-on ever since. As I said, I don't give a shit but that his posts are defaming, slanderous, libelous and outright insidious. His high and mighty accusational tone is what is weird and strange. All I have done in the past two days is to delete letters of my name and project, and the old username that I was attempting to expunge. Why?

 Your message 

Hi, you left this message on my talk page:
Thanks for experimenting with Wikipedia. Your test worked, and has been reverted. Please use the sandbox for any other tests you want to do. Take a look at the welcome page if you would like to learn more about contributing to our encyclopedia. Thanks. - Lucky 6.9 

It's difficult to tell whether you are being sarcastic or are mistaken. What experiment? I cannot find any edits or original articles of mine that you have reverted.

Regards,
 

It's a shame you felt it necessary to revert as """"experimentation"""" what was obviously an article (albeit a stub). As you will see from my history, I am new to Wikipedia but have enjoyed creating and editing a number of articles about some fairly hefty topics. It occurred to me that someone who enjoys wikipedia (such as myself) ought to be referred to as a wikipedophile. A google search reveals no fewer than 132 instances of the word on the net. If other neologisms such as """"leet"""" are to have articles, why not this one? Why not at least leave the article there for others to discuss rather than annihilating it unilaterally?

 

So, you deleted my article because you decided not enough people would be interested in it? That's as good an argument for keeping the article: nobody interested, nobody sees it; someone interested, someone finds it. No harm done. QED. Ah, but in that case, no self-aggrandising administrator satisfaction, and no opportunity to post supercilious mesages about the sandbox. It is easier to destroy than to create. Enjoy.  

OK, I will leave the subject - it is hardly a fair argument when one of us has the power to silence the other on a whim - but as an admin you will perhaps wish to know that you have discouraged me from contributing further to Wikipedia. My brief edit history will show me a valuable contributor, and I had been inspired by the """"be bold in editing"""" tenet of Wikipedia. Alas, this spirit is evidently mired in the usual unaccountable, pseudopolitical hierarchies, fiefdoms and cliques that invariably beleaguer such online efforts. Adieu.

I don't mind, but I moved your comments to my talk page instead. No, most Egyptians are not aware of Afrocentrism; it would probably never occur to them. However, most Egyptian Americans are aware because of its popularity in the African American community. Egyptians in general who encounter it often react with disbelief, dismissal, annoyance or they just don't care. With regard to being regarded as Caucasian, yes and no, it varies. Personally, I take  issue with Egyptians being described as either white or Caucasian, even though this is how the US classifies them. I know that many Egyptians, especially Egyptian Americans, would also take issue with this classification. And, yes, they consider themselves African basically; it's just not as important for them as it may be to other African communities or African Americans.

Why are Egyptians offended by Afrocentrism? Mostly because Afrocentrism to them is a form of cultural appropriation. Since most Egyptians are not black, Afrocentrists expend much energy to explain that in ways that distance Egyptians from their history. Most Egyptians take pride in their heritage, and Afrocentrism is often perceived as an attempt to """"disinherit"""" them in a way. Egyptians are sensitive both about their present and their past. There is also a perceived racism toward modern Egyptians inherent in Afrocentric thought; in particular, the spurious claim that ancient Egyptian civilization collapsed when the Egyptians supposedly became biologically or """"racially"""" """"diluted"""" by foreign invasion (an idea to which Eurocentrists/White supramicists also hold dearly). I should probably add that over the years there has been occasional tension between the Egyptian American and African American communities in general, e.g. during cultural exhibits and similar events  a relationship that is otherwise quite amicable and will hopefully continue as such.""",1.0,2.0,0.3333333333333333

I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to """"cancer"""". It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying """"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do"""", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I """"breed cancer"""", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge.

Wikipedia sued for ‘aiding neo-Nazis’
December 7, 2007 - 11:14AM

A left-wing German politician has filed charges against online encyclopaedia Wikipedia for promoting the use of banned Nazi symbols in Germany.

Katina Schubert, a deputy leader of the Left party, said she had filed the charge with Berlin police on the grounds that Wikipedia’s German language site contained too much Nazi symbolism, particularly an article on the Hitler Youth movement.

“The extent and frequency of the symbols on it goes beyond what is needed for documentation and political education, in my view,” she told Reuters. “This isn’t about restricting freedom of opinion, it’s about examining what the limits are.”

Schubert said she had taken legal advice before making her move, and that she hoped it would encourage public debate on how far internet platforms should be allowed to aid proponents of extremist, anti-semitic and racist ideologies.

“There are signs neo-Nazis are trying to take advantage of such structures, and this needs to be stopped in good time,” Schubert said. “Especially given that Wikipedia is too important to jeopardise as an open and self-regulating project.”

A spokesman for Wikimedia Deutschland, an organisation that promotes the internet lexicon in Germany, rejected the charge.

“We don’t really know what Ms Schubert’s problem is,” Arne Klempert, managing director of Wikimedia Deutschland, told Reuters. “What’s important is the context the symbols are used in, and here it’s quite clearly education and documentation.”

“Anyone who tries to prevent the Nazi period being documented properly has a strange understanding of the world, in my view,” Klempert said. “Because that’s the best weapon there is (to prevent) something like that from happening again.”

Public display of Nazi symbols is illegal in Germany, but they can be used for educational and artistic purposes.

Schubert also came under fire from party colleagues.

“Katina Schubert fails to grasp the self-regulating mechanisms that work in Wikipedia,” Heiko Hilker, a Left party media expert in Saxony’s state parliament, said in a statement.

“Right-wing extremism on the World Wide Web cannot be tackled via national criminal proceedings,” he added.

Schubert said police would pass on the charge to state prosecutors, who would decide whether to open an investigation.

Klempert said Wikipedia’s structure, which enables internet users to discuss and edit content, ensured no bias arose. “Particularly on subjects like the Hitler Youth, you can be sure it would be changed in seconds if it did (show bias),” he said.

The Hitler Youth was the Nazis’ official youth organisation.

 Spin-off, character pages 

When first writing, for example, The Brittas Empire character page, I thought it was written in 'an in-universe style'. However in retrospect this does not seem to be the case entirely, and I will be reviewing the page shortly.

Just a quick point on 'Edio*Magica', although it wasn't you who blocked me directly, it was still rather silly to think I would vandalize the very pages I have been improving (Sooty & co., The Brittas Empire), and to think that I would replace content with insults directed at myself. Due to the blocking I had to create this new account in order to edit pages, but I'm willing to forgive and forget about the misunderstanding.   
It wouldn't be the first time that someone has disrupted Wikipedia. In the past, we've had people create vandalism on one account, so that they can look good on another by fighting it. I realise, though, that your case is that there are probably some other bored little school kids using the same computer pool as you. talk to me 
Well i'm glad you've seen sense. What makes their actions even more pathetic is the fact they're university students; nevertheless they seem to have stopped now.   
Why don't you try and build an article to WP:GA standard, and get a better idea of conventions? Many of the articles you edit really could do with reliable sources. talk to me 

 Image removed from The Brittas Empire 

Are you sure the image you removed is not perfectly acceptable? It is a screen shot I took of the series so doesn't belong to any organization, and from what I’ve read relevant screen shots adding to an article are acceptable. I think you should have discussed your action before carrying it out.   
Having seen sitcom articles through FAC, I'm sure. Non-free images can only be used if they convey information that words couldn't express. My action was in accordance with the knowledge I possess through extensive ediing in accordance with Wikipedia's policy and guidelines, rather than ones I make up as I go along. talk to me

(not to mention his personal talk page is one big anti-Greek rant fest pointing to questionable FYROM news sources with highly exaggerated sensationalist titles)

""""No, Assfuckers (has a nice ring to it D) use it as a pejorative term. 

I was ready to pull the trigger on both him, admin Futper, and a few others (e.g. Macedoniaboy who says he is a """"proud fighter for united Macedonia on his talk page) with a detailed complaint about anti-Greek propaganda but since Futper managed a civil discussion with me and now seems to be sticking to debating articles (rather than threats of blocking)  I'm going to avoid escalating this further for now. ns. 

As for the current naming disputing article... I agree with you that some FYROM citizens honestly believe their claims but I don't think that reduces the existential threat to Greece. Communism fell 17 years ago in Yugoslavia and the FYROM government appears to be getting worse not better (imagine if in two hundred years they call themselves """"ethnic Athenians"""" and the cycle continues until their is no Greece left). 

There appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that FYROM leadership are confused about their own national identity (and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately). I tried to add this to the talk page of the article but Futper deleted it (arguing ancient Macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient Macedon wasn't Greek) I didn't want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since I didn't think those facts should be censored either I thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page. (assuming you see it as relevant yourself of course)

February 26, 1992: The FYROM's President Kirov Gligorov, at an interview by the Foreign Information Service daily report, Easten Europe, stated: '""""We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.'

""""January 22, 1999: The FYROM's Ambassador in Washington D.C., Mrs. Ljubica Acevska, gave a speech on the present situation in the Balkans, she stated: '""""We do not claim to be descendants of Alexander the Great. We are Slavs and we speak a Slavic language. Greece is The FYROM's second largest trading partner and its number one """"investor.""""'

February 24, 1999: The FYROM.'s Ambassador to Canada, Gyordan Veselinov, in an interview with the """"Ottawa Citizen"""", he admitted: '""""We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are Slavs and our language is closely related to Bulgarian. There is some confusion about our identity.""""'

I think the above needs to be compared to that of their current hard line prime minister's recent behavior. He directly contradicts FYROM's own government's previous comments about themselves (that apparently was unauthentically meant to assure foreigners that Greeks were imagining FYROM propaganda and to reduce the issue to a childish dispute over simply names.. in order to get recognition)

Prime Minister Gruevski officially meets Prince Ghazanfar of Pakistan] who claims to be related to Alexander the Great.. then uses it as an opportunity to suggest FYROM citizens are related to ancient Macedonians. (and don't get me started on that incident where Gruevski layed a wreath where a picture of """"United Macedonia"""" was clearly present... which also seems to be missing from the existing article)

Answer to Mütze
Well, I am surprised to see that I am unblocked! At least, you still have seen that you targeted the wrong person for the wrong reasons!!

Mütze, I have used this Wikipedia for only a few days but I am still not an idiot. Of course, what I say further below on what I think you did is an assumption but I believe a very good one! Here is what you did. You saw the following I posted on the Bosendorfer discussion page:
""""Very soon, this article will be published and you will have to leave it this way; otherwise, the censors at Wikipedia will be forced to side with me (!!) considering the fact that I gave you the opportunity to challenge what I wrote in my article."""".

As you clearly told me yourself, you did not want my article to be published. This quote clearly threatened you because I told taht I will soon publish my article and it will be with the full support of everybody because I used the discussion page of Bosendorfer. You then contacted Andrew Norman to block me to prevent me from editing the Bosendorfer discussion page and then you thought you could keep me away on my own user page with the intention of blocking me indefinitively. When you blocked me indefinitively through RobertG, you knew too well that no one could read my user page afterward! That is what I believe you did! And it is probably easily verifiable by people at Wikipedia.

Now, what is your role at Wikipedia? You are not an administrator; otherwise you would have blocked me yourself directly!

Anyway, I propose to carry on the discussion on the Bosendorfer discussion page concerning my article. I am ready to change sentences that cause problems. It is just up to you to mention these problematic sentences on this Bosendorfer discussion page and if you have a valid reason to have this sentence changed, it will be changed. I am not a fanatic and I am ready to please people. I will use logic and reason to assess a request to change sentences, not emotions. If I do not want to change a sentence, I will say clearly why and we could discuss further on this refusal to accept a change if it happens.

And I will answer the points you raised in your previous postings, Mütze.

So, I hope you will behave a little bit more relaxed about what I intend to do. The goal: publish a good article on a good product that inform people who read it. Apparently, for the time being, mostly the group of administrators and their friends (!!) who are the only ones who complained about my article so far.

But to have had to go through such a nightmare just to want to publish a good article on Wikipedia is surely not the right way to do at Wikipedia with people who are ready to contribute positively!! You are really going to put people off wanting to write on Wikipedia! And I especially target the administrators who have been in contact with me in a very aggressive way. Just a few days ago, I did not even know that what an administrator was at Wikipedia!

Here is what Jimbo Wales says on his user page:
""""Newcomers are always to be welcomed. There must be no cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers."""".
If he knews what I had to go through and the very aggressive behaviour I experienced from administrators at Wikipedia, he would not be very pleased. What I say above, he call it one of his main principles!

So, administrators, when you contact people, make sure you remember this very core principle of one of the founders of Wikipedia and target the true vandals instead of people like me who are willing to add a good article to Wikipedia!

Jimbo Wales wants people to write as many articles as possible on Wikipedia. Your role as administrators is to help and encourage them to do so instead of trying to block them indefinitively!

So, I hope you can now all relax and not get emotional or upset on this coming article. I follow the process used by Wikipedia to deal with an article that causes opposition. See the new comments now on the Bosendorfer discussion page and state the sentences that cause you problems and especially why these sentences are problematic. Then, I will do my best to change them to please everybody.

 Fuck you, cunt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

try these important things and maybe you won't be such a sucker motherfucker:

1. Learn how to spell. If things remain as they are, everyone is bound to consider you to be the ignorant lame-brained cult member you are.

2. Revert your attacks on Van Tucky on the talk pages. You come off as a vicious, vile psychopath. If you ever set your cult defending ass in a court of law, the jury would see through your charade in heartbeat.

3. Stop playing good cop- bad cop with your fucking retarded Dahn hack Forestgarden

4. Accept all Korean language sources you stupid bitch!! How dare you try to stifle and censor articles in the name of your fucked up cult. Your Forestgarden bitch believes its within Wiki policy to include Korean language articles when reporting on favorable aspects of your bitch master. Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?

5. Stop using the word cynical to describe your """"enemies."""" You come off even more retarded than your Ilchee bitch master. Your philosophical maturity is less than that of a first grader. The world is """"cynical."""" Those who don't believe in Dahn are """"cynical."""" I can't wait until South Park makes an episode about your bitch cult. 

6. Are you fucking insane? Korea is the center of the universe? Korea as a cultural hub? Korea the place where the next messiah appears? You Dahn people never cease to amaze when it comes to your thought processes. Korea is not what your Ilchee bitch believes it to be. Think about it retard- the fucking nation of Palau has more of a right to talk about religious heritage than the fucking hermit kingdom. How can you be so retarded, that you choose a Korean cult? If you chose a Chinese or Indian one, at least it would show you have some portion of a brain. Coming to Korea and joining a Korean cult with Korea-centric views is more retarded than travelling to Antartica in search of good coffee while visiting Columbia in search of ice and snow.

7. One more time: the philosophical underpinnings of your shit cult are so flimsy I must question your intelligence.

8. Nicola Cola...what kind of bitch ass name is that? what is wrong with you?

And you wonder why you need to join a fucked up cult to find friendship and loving. Dumb fuck!!!!!!""",2.0,1.0,0.3333333333333333

Yeah this one right here goes out to all the baby's mamas, mamas...
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas, mamas
Yeah, go like this

CHORUS: Andre 3000
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]

Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]

Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Big Boi]
My baby's drama mama, don't like me
She be doin things like havin them boys come from her neighborhood 
to the studio tryin to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance 
to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts 
for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

CHORUS:
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]

Me and your daughter.. got a special thang goin on
You say it's puppy love (arf arf arf)
We say it's full grown (ARF ARF WOOF!)
Hope that we feel this.. feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
but you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
on the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too long
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Askin what happened to the feelin that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything is cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, 
and graduation

CHORUS:
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]

Uh, uh, yeah
""""Look at the way he treats me"""" 
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass homegirls 
done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle 
and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin no more 
cause my dick all in her mouth
You know what I'm talking about Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, and D to the G they be the same thing
So who you placin the blame on, you keep on singin the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on

Fadix is right. This page gives special treatment to Turkey, unlike similar pages on massacres, genocide, etc. It doesn't deserve a single bit more.
Blue there is nothing wrong with having an academic position.

I guess JFD is trying to discourage you to get in touch with me via e-mail, since he fears some kind of academical threat. Just to clear some things up, I was not the guy who went """"India did not exist until 1947"""". I would never post something as blunt, offensive, and ignorant as that. However, yes, I have changed a few things around as a correction. It is not to offend anyone, but like Kenneth Tennyson and his devoted sidekick JFD (the Green Hornet and Kato), I too have some historical points of views. I understand that you have been accused of being a pan-Indian nationalist, while I have been accused of being a Tamil nationalist. As far as Indian martial arts are concerned, martial arts from both your culture and mine are in the Indian martial arts section. Therefore, it effects both of us.

It seems like through this wiki-conflict, it has thrown us together into one pot. If I am here to put you or your culture down, or to discredit India, why in the first place would I have stuck up for you. I had not intentions in mind when I did that. It just ticked me off when Kenneth sent you that messed up message. Just like, for example, a few years ago, when a Punjabi store owner was beaten up in a hate crime. I was outraged...

I see you have a vast knowledge in the fighting styles of Northern Inda, while I have the same for Southern India. Likewise, you are very knowledgeable about ancient Bharat and its 16 Mahajanapada Republics, while I have the same for ancient Tamilakkam. Since this page on Indian Martial Arts effects us both, maybe together we can combine our knowledges to present a remarkable page. Yes, I do understand our passions which may sometimes clash. However, if we could set aside some of that and work together in a """"give-take"""" mentality we can make things work.

At the same time, we will present our contributions which may be opposite of what JFD-Kenny think, but at the same time their views shall be presented as well to give a fair and balanced view on Indian Martial Arts.

Do you agree with me on this? If so, it would be nice if we could communicate via e-mail. I have more ideas to share with you. I believe we can make this work. As far as JFD is concerned, I do not know what his intentions are. Maybe he feels a little threatened of the possiblity of you and me teaming up on this project? or maybe I am wrong...""",1.0,2.0,0.3333333333333333

You said that advisors are stationed in Georgia proper, so it's a Georgian mission. Well done! Xeeron, I get 2.87 million links when I google """"South Ossetia War"""". That's English buddy. If only Xeeron, you read the title """"SECURITY COUNCIL HOLDS THIRD EMERGENCY MEETING AS SOUTH OSSETIA CONFLICT INTENSIFIES, EXPANDS TO OTHER PARTS OF GEORGIA"""" South Ossetia Conflict (War) expands, as in already expanded, it says expands, NOT expanding, or about to expand, therefore, the UN knowingly named the war the [2008] South Ossetia War, KNOWING that it will expand. See how important reading the title, and getting the correct title is? My arguments haven't evaporated anywhere; South Ossetia is still location-based (my initial argument); it is still where over 90% of the fighting took place; it still has the most important battle (Tskhinvali); my arguments are still here buddy. And Xeeron, I have pointed to you countless times that might doesn't make right. Saying the majority says so, does NOT make it NPOV. If you would have lived in the South during the Civil Rights Movenment you'd realize that might doesn't make right, or NPOV for that matter. I've seen your majority view point and called it a farce many times. Grey Fox - I have proof for how the """"2008 Georgia War"""" is biased; it is biased because it IMPLIES that South Ossetia was a De Facto part of Georgia - which as we all know is bullshit, because if a region is De Facto and De Jure part of a country - there is no war! My Russian colleagues may disagree, but Chechnya was not De Facto part of Russia in the 1990's, it was De Jure. And it was called the Second Chechen War, not the Russian War 1999-2006. So in other words Mr. Grey Fox, and the other two of you, you have FAILED to show my how 2008 South Ossetia War is NPOV, but I HAVE shown you, and cited an example of how 2008 Georgia War would be incorrect and biased.

Here's a hint. If your textbooks in grade schools didn't claim Israel doesn't have a right to exist, if parents in your society weren't teaching their kids that blowing up my people is a wonderful thing that will get them 72 virgins, if your government didn't name streets after mass murderers, pay blood money to the parents of mass murderers, put them on camera hailing their kids as heroes, and if YOUR PEOPLE weren't spending their time and money on buying weapons and digging smuggling tunnels instead of fixing infrastructure, starting businesses, and building better lives, then there would be no need for checkpoints, no need for a big-ass wall, no need for anything of the sort. And you'd have your state. You'd have had it decades ago if your goal was to have a state.

You could have been living freely, if the Arab states had accepted the offer, signed a nonagression pact, and let you come home instead of stuffing your parents inside """"refugee camps"""" cynically turning you into shock troops and poster children for """"oh look what the Jews did to 'our people' when we stuffed them into refugee camps instead of taking the easy way to let them go home.""""

You could have had a Palestinian state in 1948. You could have had one at any time after that.

But it's as you say. """"On the last day, even the rocks and the trees will shout 'O Muslim, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him!""""

Oh really? Tell me, Dab, are you an atheist? You have to answer this question. How can you say that “It really shouldn't matter”? It matters! If you are a theist, you will try to say something negative about atheism. You will try to collect useless criticism of atheism from pro-religious websites.

Look, most theists don’t understand atheism properly. They have little knowledge about science and if they were to understand the meaning of reason and science, they will become atheists. Most theists cannot make a distinction between Intelligent Design and Evolution. They fail to understand why Intelligent Design is a pseudoscience and Evolution is a valid science.

Lewis was """"very angry with God for not existing"""". I am an atheist and I am not angry with God for not existing. I know that God does not exist.

You clearly know very little about the repertoire of the 10-string guitar and as little about the difference between multi-string guitars and the type of guitar that Narciso Yepes invented (which is NOT simply a multi-stringed guitar or simply a 10-stringED guitar). It MUST be defined separately from multi-string guitars because of its primary characteristic and raison d'etre, which are characteristics NOT shared by other multi-string guitars. It belongs under Classical Guitar, and it deserves its own definition. Neither your ignorance nor your bias against Yepes nor your preference for your own favourite guitarists will stop the truth from coming out!

Also, please educate yourself as regards the repertoire for the 10-string guitar rather than claiming stupidly and falsely that no one of any significance but Ohana ever wrote music for 10-stringed guitars. You are not informing anyone, only showing your own bias and/or ignorance.

There is nothing inherently POV about discussing Israeli violence against Palestinian children. It is a fact. It is a recognized problem as the data in the article reflects.

If you checked my contributions for wikipedia over the last 2 years you would realise i have added far more than any of those users on the ANI board, i have no idea why i got banned for calling GoodDay for what he truly is, if you check the chatlogs you would see he has spouted out many abusive insults, i do not insult people i just call it as it is, i accept a 2 week ban then but please tell GoodDay to stop stalking my userpage, leaving me messages and pasting around my Ip address and spreading lies about my brother he seems to have an obession with, this is clearly all against wiki policy and abuse. also note i am most likely getting the local authorities in on this issue 86.10.119.131  ","""

Boothy, as much difficulty as you and some of the other true believers seem to have with this concept, not everything is a matter of opinion, and not all opinions are equally valid. When I post to an article about the city of Chicago, I do so as somebody who actually does live here, has done so for a good long time, and knows the place firsthand - something that the idiots who did the reverts can't legitimately claim for themselves. You've offered a vague remark about how I have a problem with some of the editor's """"opinions""""; in true Usenet fashion, giving the spin while leaving out the awkward details.

The """"opinions"""" given are on such subjects as what the lowest reported temperature in Chicago was, whether or not cheese customarily appears on an Italian Beef sandwich, and other things which, like these, aren't a matter of guesswork, but of simple observation. One of the additions I made to the article which somebody, I believe yourself, wiped out with a revert mentioned the """"arctic express"""" winter of 1981-82. When one takes the already silly concept of NPOV, and exaggerates it to the point at which one wipes out mentions of actual historical events which one just doesn't happen to have been will informed enough about the subject to havew heard of, one has reached a level of lunacy unusual even by the standards of the Internet and postmodernism. I said this before and will stand by it - anybody who feels that the mention of an unusually cold winter is too much cointroversy for the site to handle obviously has issues that cry out for medication.

So let's not act like I was getting angry because one of the """"editors"""" (read: overly pushy posters) disagreed with me about what the best movie of May was, or anything of that sort, which is clearly the impression that you're trying to leave the reader with. My well-justified anger comes from the fact that somebody has used censorship in an attempt to conceal the fact that he didn't know what he was talking about when he wrote that article. I might say that same about the people who did the reverts, including, for example, somebody from """"Concordia"""", wherever that is - somewhere far enough from Chicago that most of us have never even heard of it. And yet this person feels qualified to vet additions to an article on Chicago.

That's messed up. - Joseph from Chicago""",1.0,2.0,0.3333333333333333

I am aware of wikipedia policy and don't need to reread it. I broke policy knowingly. I apologize for doing so. It was for the sake of whimsy. That impulse has left me, and I make the promise that it will not return. I do not retract anything that I said. The bigger issue which I have been addressing is the flaw within the system itself. After repeated requests to actually read what I'm saying here and what I actually said on the Beat Generation page, you clearly have mistunderstood me. Your claim that you have ignored evidence in the prosecution of my punishment is one among many disturbing signs of the flaws within the Wikipedia system. What you call extraneous issues are indeed central issues. You have done little to convince me otherwise. For example, the sockpuppetry was a bad idea when considering rules of civility, and I won't let it happen again. It was a good idea in that it was funny, but like I said, that's out of my system. The bigger issue  a central issue, not extraneous  is that admins claimed I was being dishonest. This is evidence of laziness and lack of real concern for the real job you are meant to do. If the real problem is that I was uncivil, then I apologize and make an honest promise that I will never do it again. I don't believe that really is a central issue. I'm not blaming anyone else for me being uncivil; I chose to do it and have never claimed otherwise. The problem is Wikipedia is a toilet. Why is it a toilet? Wikipedia is a punchline. Why is it a punchline? Because people who passionately care about truth get angry (even if it was pretend) on occassion? No. I realize uncivil behavior can be a contributing factor in that it can fail to lead to a positive change; I was practically begging for a positive change on the Beat Generation page, and nothing was happening. Certain other editors were relying on Wikipedia rules to stymie progress. Block me or don't block me, I don't care (and judging from the history of this process and my history with Tao  I fear you'll scan this for trigger words, see """"I don't care"""" and say, """"If you don't care, why are you wasting my time?"""" totally missing the point of what I'm actually saying)  but please look in the mirror and think about the real problem here. If you skip the first part where I genuinely apologize for the actual infraction and said I would never do it again (just as I genuinely apologized for the infraction last time and said I would never do it again  and I can keep saying this over and over again) and if you once again just look at this part and claim I'm focusing on extraneous issues and incorrectly claim that I'm blaming others  blaming others for my rant? no, please actually see: my rant is my responsibility, and once again I apologize for it  whatever you do, despite my lack of faith in anyone's ability to genuinely take some time and think about these things, please just consider what's right and what's wrong here on a larger level while in the short term focusing on my genuine heart-felt apology. (Not short, sorry, but I do have a soul and genuinely care about truth.)  """,""" The apologetic bee in your bonnet is based on a refusal to admit that words change meaning through time.  The linguistic argument about the word """"exhorter"""" could not have been made even a hundred years ago because too many people then would have understood its context.

I thought that bit was the most agreeable part. All kidding aside: People who would lose all respect for someone else based on one outburst deserve no respect themselves in turn (i.e. """"outburst"""" doesn't include going on an RL killling spree or the like of course). I'm still that same guy, sometimes full of shit (includes humor), sometimes with some or even much professional attitude. Maybe I needed it. Maybe not. I like to think that I had to get out some things. And since I'm not the least bit interested in joining WR or another of those places, I had to do it here. And instead of doing it latently, I now got all that out of my system in one outburst. You see, when I usually comment e.g. on what I perceive as a bad-faith RfA oppose, I was constantly holding back, trying to stick to the rules (most of the time anyway). But that sticking to the rules is a rotten """"primary directive"""", and calling spade spade is even more necessary, because it's simply more accurate. And to do it in the form of an alc-induced (or rather, triggered) outburst affords a good option for everyone to ignore the content of what I said, as opposed to constantly complaining about this editor or that comment.

On the other hand: The way things turned out on my initial (very civil, let's not forget that!) posting to AN/I was yet another clear message of how cronyism rules the upper echelons. — Dorftrottel⁠ """,1.0,0.0,0.0

I always welcome feedback for my efforts, most of which nowadays are editing and writing narrative nonfiction and novels.

I especially love it when those who would criticize another's work do it decently and respectfully.

 ==Lies and more lies from an unstable admin== 

Totally, completely untrue.
If you examine the history and comments I've left, you'll see that the few people who are responsible for warring on my contributions have routinely vandalized and destroyed my legitimate contributions, while for the most part when I've reverted to my versions I've usually tried to respectfully retain the valuable additions and changes they've made.
Also, universally recongnized FACTS DO NOT require """"sourcing"""" and links. EVERYONE in New York State KNOWS as FACT that Deborah Glick favors big-government solutions, high-tax/high-spend policies, is against ALL citizens having ANY Self-Defense Rights involving gun ownership, believes that ONLY police should have all the guns, and that all her economic policies, which she CLAIMS are to """"help"""" the """"disadvantaged and poor"""", FLY IN THE FACE of accepted economic LAW.

Now, I guess you do have the temporary power to disable me, but you'll only be furthher discrediting YOURSELF. Even the Wikipedia Administrators who have complained to me about my reverts and re-edits have admitted and openly SAID that ANYONE has the right to edit ANY page, as long as they do not violate the 3-Revert-24 Rule; if you care, go back and review where they said that multiple times.

I have every right to edit any article at least once per day; and my posts consist mainly of ADDITIONS to articles, not deleting portions of other people's contributions. All of my contributions involve generally adding additional information, opposing viewpoints and the pewrspective of critics; ALl my opponents edits consist of deleting my contributions and trying to silence my participation here.

So go ahead, try totally freezing me. I will simply write to the Wikipedia headquarters and request that they review the official record, and your biased actions and statements. I will quickly be restored to my privileges, because you have no case, and you are just harrasing me because of whatever prejudices, bias or immature resentments you harbor.

I could never be humiliated or embarrassed by a small person like you; administrators of your ilk have already demonstrated that you would be better taking kindergarten and grammar school over again than trying to manage and lead other people who have achieved adulthood long ago.

I'll clear this up about my intentions:  I have been told, or glanced over (in passing) several materials purporting the Caribbean slave contribution to the population of Charleston and Savannah (among New Orleans and other multiracially populated areas).  It is also rather obvious about the romantic Pocahontas connection to ideas of Roanoke survivors, in discussions of Virginia.  These things are dismissed as fancy, but they are distinct beliefs of those who attempt to put a face on what the Melungeon community has had as an inception.  So you see, I am an extreme skeptic to the fantasies described by ignorant rednecks...but I do in fact think they are relevant to the beliefs of those promoting the Melungeon identity.  One need not endorse a belief of association, but merely allow others to see what sort of identities Melungeon life has acquired.  I am confident to declare that there is so much myth obfuscating the reality of what life is like in Appalachia.  Appalachian culture is from the Deep South to Maritime Canada.  Melungeon culture is centred on the Gulf coast and south of Bermuda on the Eastern seaboardoriginally Spanish areas.  People think that just because impoverished Scotch-Irish on the frontier dressed in buckskin and furs, that they were some """"noble savages"""" (though they were not Cherokee, but in fact Andrew Jackson's henchmen).  So many ideas here wreak of Crank (person) nonsense.  Are you the spin doctors making apologetics for the Antebellum South, by having it seem like the perpertrators are actually descended from the victims?  Are you sitting in a trailor right now, trying to deny your Jerry Springer lifestyle?  Civil War's Reconstruction is a real bitch?!

That white Spanish territory is the Melungeon core, in true history.

See here:
Hispanics contributed Melungeon heritage, via Louisiana and Florida colonies.  This was much different from slave owners who raped slaves to make more slaves.  Melungeons were basically the first Hispanics in the United States, whom often lived in secret or adapted to Anglo ways.  Please, do not spread fantasies as facts in this article!

As for any alleged """"Meatpuppet Campaign,"""" yes, I made posts on LiveJournal asking for people to come over and review the article. I invite everyone to review the posts.  conveniently gone through the trouble of tracking them down, and they are available in the RfC he's preparing agaisnt me. Several LJ Users voiced distress, and I offered advice. This happens all the time in Wikipedia's IRC channel. This is far from an organized campaign, and I dispute the claim firmly. 

I'm do not know where all of these IP users came from. In the event that they did come from LiveJournal, I have edited the LJ posts I made, asking any users who came to Wikipedia to read through an introduction to Wikipedia, and to create an account. I also put emphasis against Personal attacks. I can't do anything more about it. If you feel this is untrue, then please, please, bring it up to me, before your decide to take up other peoples' time with the issue. I know I make mistakes, and I try to fix them when I can. I like people to tell me when they think I make them, as obviously, I don't realize all of them. 

Personal Attacks: I called  """"ignorant."""" In the atmosphere I've developed in, that's not anything close to an attack. I do apologize if anyone took offense to it, as they seem to have.

This is the only personal attack I remember anyone bringing to me. If you have others, please tell me. Otherwise, please stop saying that I am attacking anyone. It was an isolated incident, and we both seem to have gotten over it. Why can't you? Stop bringing it up. 

During the time I was gone, a bunch of anonymous users seem to have popped up here. However, none popped up at any of the other articles I am concerned with (Scottish Clans; view my contributions if you're interested). I refute any claims that are made to connect me with these users.

 Also concerning TheCommish21 

First of all, your statement about the Underground Football League was incorrect.  It is not a fantasy football league.  The UFL is a full-contact, tackle football league based in Macungie, PA, that attracts teenagers (ranging from 9th to 12th graders) from all over the Lehigh Valley.  There are referees, statisticians, an official rulebook, and permenant teams.  It is not just a hobby that was created without any sort of solid foundation.  It's website is growing rapidly, with nearly 6000 hits since the beginning of October.  Merely because it is local and young, does not mean that it doesn't hold a solid enough position in the world to have a Wikipedia page.  Your response to the Perl citation was a weak showing of how the UFL did not deserve a page.  Perhaps there are people who are very interested in football.  They might be interested in seeing how leagues in other areas.  If someone has a vested interest in something, they should be allowed to access information about it.  Isn't that what Wikipedia is all about?

Second, merely because you have a personal vendetta against TheCommish21 does not mean that you have the right to block him and deny his appeal to be unblocked.  And you and WarthogDemon both know that he never referred to you as """"cyberidiots.""""  The term was """"cyber police.""""  I don't understand how you can hold yourself in such high esteem if you are lowering yourself to mocking those whom you have problems with.  You should have allowed an unbiased administrator to approve or deny the appeal, and you should not have just gone ahead and done it yourself.  Also, you block over 30 people per day.

Well I used to work up at the mall for a store(which has since closed), and I know all the inside """"dirt"""" as to why nobody wants to bring any new business, industry, or stores here.  I can't get into the specific details(that's an entirely different topic), but I can tell you that the entire mall has been a money loser for several years now.  Cambridge Shopping Centers has placed it up for sale time and time again.  Nobody wants it, and I don't blame them.  If Sears ever decides to pull out of there, they might as shut the entire place down and bulldoze it, because the land is worth more than the mall itself.  Everything is going Northside anyway.  Downtown Chatham has been a cesspool ever since the recession of the 90's, and it never fully recovered.  And the Capitol Theatre? Give me a break.  They might as well give up on that too.  It's been what? Over ten years now, and after all the time and money that was pissed away on that thing, we stil aren't any closer to it being finished, or having a final completion date.

 Are you being deliberately obtuse? 

I know this is a scientific subject, but it seems that the writer of the article is being deliberately obtuse.  I quote:

""""The ear for example, takes a spectral decomposition of sound as part of the process of turning sound into neural stimulus, so certain time domain effects are inaudible.""""

Now, I'm grappling with what that sentence means. I think I know what you are trying to convey, but your method of speech is stupefying.  I am not a scientist, by the way, just someone interested in the subject of sound, so when presented with a sentence like the one above, I think to myself: """"Is this guy taking the piss?""""  I used to write this badly at A-level when I wanted to impress the teacher I wanted to shag.  It looks nice, all very academic, but it conveys its meaning poorly.  

A tip from a writer: When conveying a difficult idea, be explicit - avoid pompous, vague or technical statements unless you have no choice.

If you really must couch an explanation in such technical jargon, add a second clarifying sentence for us mere mortals who do not understand the scientific jargon.  Start a second sentence with 'In other words,' and repeat what you are trying to convey in very simply, easy language.  Example:

""""In other words, some frequencies are lost when interpreting the physical sound we hear.""""

I'm not entirely sure if that was what you were trying to say, because your original sentence was so palpably obtuse.  But I'm sure you get the gist: if you absolutely, positively have to use technical language, ensure that you follow it up with a layman's explanation as best you can.  It doesn't matter if you can't convey what you mean absolutely accurately, because the layman can then go back and read your original technical sentence and try to piece together what you are saying given the context of the easier sentence.  

For God's sake, once in a while go back and read what you are writing.  This whole article is riddled with raving gibberish and obfuscation.  Absolutely unreadable!

===April 2012===
 
Your recent editing history at Centrifugal force shows that you are currently engaged in an edit war. Being involved in an edit war can result in your being blocked from editing—especially if you violate the three-revert rule, which states that an editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page within a 24-hour period. Undoing another editor's work—whether in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material each time—counts as a revert. Also keep in mind that while violating the three-revert rule often leads to a block, you can still be blocked for edit warring—even if you don't violate the three-revert rule—should your behavior indicate that you intend to continue reverting repeatedly.
 
To avoid being blocked, instead of reverting please consider using the article's talk page to work toward making a version that represents consensus among editors.

 Civility and stuff 

Regarding my last WP:FOOTY input, i have already replied you there. Here, i'll only add, other than a second apology to you, WP, WP:FOOTY and (some of) those concerned with some of the contents of my input: i can cope with being called """"stupid"""" (what's intelligence anyway), but VILE? Please think about what you wrote as well my friend.

Attentively -   
The events of the last week have been very disturbing and I was offended by what you said, so I can only imagine how someone who lost a loved one would've reacted to your comment. As I said before, think about what you write before you click that save button. Comparing a cheating footballer to a mass murder is wrong. talk 

I'll try to """"defend"""" myself once again, as i feel i did not manage it the last time around: i only chose that comparison to illustrate the level of vandalism occurring in the footballer's page (i did not compare anyone, i merely """"reasoned"""" - or did not! - if this occurs in a mere footballer page, what can be done with a real scumbag like that mass murderer and the ones like him), i only chose a very unfortunate example to guide me by. I guess you are very upset at me, and there's nothing i can say at this moment to """"turn back the tide"""", so i'll just be quiet for now...

No friends in real life, still have time to make enemies in the virtual world, even though i intend just the opposite -   
You don't have to apologise to me, I'm not going to hold it against you. It was an off the cuff remark and we all make them. If you look at the editing history of Sam Deering you will see an expansion I made after answering a request to do so. I found something unsavoury that he said during his time at Oxford United and in my edit summary I made a comment about his intellect, which I shouldn't have.

I believe Serbia's first ever involvement with Kosova after 1912 was when in 1989 Milosevic made his famous """"Greater Serbia"""" speech in Kosova, started to move Serbs into the county and then send his Serb troops to invade the land and expand Serbia's territory, followed by the ethnic cleansing of Albanians/non-Serbs, and genocide of the rest.

If there is something about ADD in there, it must in some kind of code that my old ass can't decipher, but I heard no such admission. As for using YouTube as a source, I wouldn't accept it as one. I don't know if there is a policy about YouTube not being used, but I tend to replace YouTube links anyway because they are forever removing videos and if something is true and noteworthy, there would be more than just a video source. In this case, I found nothing else to back up the ADD claim. Perhaps the person who wants to include it should give find a secondary source because the one provided doesn't back up the content.

 Comment from Homosexuality (workspace) 

Actually, my citation can be the very same 2000 Breedlove study that our friend in Farmington includes in Fetal hormones and sexual orientation. Background is that length of ring finger relative to index finger is strongly correlated with fetal testosterone levels. That fact is rather well established quite apart from sexual orientation. Breedlove found an additional much weaker correlation between implied fetal testosterone and sexual orientation, with lesbians in particularly being most strongly androgynized. It's definitely interesting. Gay men show the same pattern (gays more androgynized), but to a smaller degree.

However, there is a huge overlap between the suggested fetal testosterone levels and sexual orientation. That is, on average of a bunch of lesbians had higher fetal testosterone than a paired group of straight women. But many lesbians had lower fetal testosterone than the straight-woman average. And many straight women had higher fetal testosterone than the lesbian average. The standard deviation within each group is much more than the mean difference between the groups.

So what does it show? Well, I dunno. There's something potentially interesting there, especially if it can be replicated in much larger samples. But it's hardly clear causation, nor even clear correlation. What it amounts to might be something like (purely hypothetically): """"High testesterone exposure female fetuses have a 10% chance of becoming lesbian; low testosterone exposure female fetuses have a 5% chance of becoming lesbian."""" But that's about the strongest conclusion I can imagine coming out of this (and it hasn't yet, it's been suggested), and that's a relatively weak factor.

 DEAR Anonymous EE Guy,
 
Well, I don't know if you really mean to give a full picture of the case, but we could include this one:
 
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm
 
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/
 
Who are the web site of Jean-Pierre Voyer, a kind of model person for mister Messager/YBM, and who spred a quiet special form for ideologie, which goal is to play with words and how to defend and argue about things who do not exist, how to play with words and """"fuck others"""" as phrased on his web site, and essentialy, how to display a superior attitude in order to effectively use the communication on internet to their full interest, by using the circumstances frame of the dialogues. This include displaying lies as being facts with such a forcefullness as to convince others.
It is called: postsituationnisme, ideologie who is followed by YBM, together with a sympathie to the 3rd reich, and a, by some, called pseudo-Hégelianism.
YBM run his forum where he defend the man and his positions, with as much furore as he dispells those of Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
You will found in it concepts as the Superior Race, versus the inferior race, and different creativs ways to talk the technics and language of publicity into a way of """"mass communication"""" and a weapon to convince anyone of anything.
 
I am sure that this angle will bring a certain shade of light where it was upmost needed, and will constitute the missing piece of the puzzle.
 
I hope you will excuse my very late assertion or révélation about this subject, but I was myself only made aware of it for a very short time ago, together with the fact that this Voyer and YBM have harrassed people before, writers too, for books who had nothing to do with science, but nevertheless constituted those 2 mens lifes mening for 2 years.
Actually they stopped with their first victims at the end of 2002, beginning of 2003, to consacrate their cherish technics of manipulating the masses, and ideologies of diffamation on 2 other subjects, Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
 
No need to say that the 2 former victims are still paying for the vices of Voyer and Messager, and that their lifes and career have been destroyed.
 
Why so much hate against people they didn't knew and had never met?
They were only practicing, like serial killers start somewhere, in the shadow, and are only known for much more exposed actions.

Here are some other links who do compleete the picture:

I consider this information for being central in the matter at hand, as all accusations will have fallen and nothing much will have come from the original and following J. Baez paper on the subject if it hadn't been for Messager and Voyers' questionnable work in the name of very questionnable motives, all accomplished to serve a completely useless ideology.
I think that this will teach us all a lesson regarding objectivity and our hability to evaluate a given problem properly, and to be able to use our sense of sceptisisme ans sound judgement.  On a more general way and even more central here, our power to distinguish between agreeing to a given opinion based on facts, and being manipulate in doing so for all the wrong reasons.

Brief history: On my return from holiday, last week, I discovered that another editor,  had posted a  which criticises my conduct and alleges that I am part of a concert-party aimed at articles substantially edited by him. During May 26h., I tried to add comments to the page and then had a discussion with him, above, which closed the matter between us.The following day, I posted links on the Talk pages of the other alleged conspirators, one of whom is . The entire correspondence with him reads as follows:

==Discussion involving you==You might be interested in the discussion on my 'Talk Page', here, which indirectly involves you. It is disappointing that the author has not notified you himself.  (talk) Seen all that. Out of context, of course, in every sense. In addition its dredged up from some time back when we were all wrapped over the knuckles then. It seems he wants people perpetually punished for not agreeing with him or for voting on the same pages. I'd hate to list all the AfD and other pages he and Vintagekits collaborate on. But thats all right. Regards,  :Yes; the image of a dog licking its own balls comes to mind. (talk) 

The metaphor is supposed to represent a self-indulgent act which gives great pleasure to the participant but which others view as embarrassing and repulsive.

The next thing I know is that some random Admin has popped up, blocked me, and disappeared again, reappearing on the Administrator's Noticeboard waving my scalp around. The diff link on the Noticeboard refers to the last post only, and a number of commentators on the Noticeboard immediately agree with the view that it is a WP:NPA.

I pause here to point out that either the Admin herself, or I (before I was blocked), could have blanked the comment, perhaps with a warning on this Talk page. I would have been perfectly happy to have done so myself, because I like to think of myself as reasonable and because the post was not intended as an attack; had I wished to criticise  I would have done so on my own Talk page discussion with him. (As it is,  had the sense to blank the discussion in any case.)

Anyway, that said, I reply as follows to those who have posted comments here:

' I hope that I have demonstrated that we're at cross-purposes. Frankly, however, you've made no attempt to engage with either myself or  or to resolve the dispute between us. You might just as well have blocked one of us at random.

' Thank you for yours. You're the dog's bollocks!

' Point taken, for what it's worth (I had initially understood 's complaint to be with the vulgarity of the metaphor rather than her seeing it as an attack). !vote discussions increasingly resemble a mass outbreak of Tourette's syndrome.

' Thank you for yours. I note you seem to have had rather an unpleasant discussion with  yourself on the subject, and I should like to thank you for your interest and understanding. I have also had a look at your User page, which I found very interesting and would like to comment further on your Talk page in due course. To answer your point, I did see how to request an unblock, but as the block was only for 24 hours, and the ground had anyway been cut from under my feet by 's posting on the Administrator's Noticeboard which had garnered approval for the block. I also dislike complaining to Admins about other people's behaviour; it just seems a bit wet to me (and I don't do it myself).

 Discussion 

This article does an awful job maintaining an objective viewpoint, it is undeniable. It is a travesty to make it appear as though Mark Kirk opposes the war in Iraq despite the fact that he helped write and co-sponsored the House Resolution to invade Iraq in 2003.

It is also absolutely ridiculous to boast that he received an award from the League of Conservation Voters, and yet fail to mention that the very same group gave him an """"F"""" rating last Congressional session. Absolutely misleading.

I do not often edit wikipedia, and am not quite sure how to correctly cite these facts. This page does not paint an accurate portrait of Mark Kirk.I ask somebody to help me correctly cite the credible sources of these facts in order to maintain this great site's credibility. 74.93.94.125  an informed voter in the tenth district""","""
You quickly forget that I am objecting to the MISINTERPRETATION of a 'rule', and the MISAPPLICATION of a 'rule'.   (or, do you not concede that, hypothetically, a VALID, proper rule can be MISINTERPRETED and/or MISAPPLIED?).  Merely citing the RULE is pointless, when the problem is the misinterpretation or misapplication of the rule!
 Further, Dodo violated WP rules, by not allowing a consensus of the group to develop.  He also misapplied a rule, claiming that something I said must be 'verifiable'.  But what does it mean, to be 'verified'?  Dodo implied that what I said must be verifiably, scientifically TRUE.  I claim, quite to the contrary, that since the article involved is 'Jim Bell' (subject, ME), that the only 'verifiability' issue is this:  Did 'James Dalton Bell' ACTUALLY make these claims.  (Or, conversely and hypothetically, 'is someone else forging his identity?, etc.)   For example, there was no need to RUSH and delete my posts.  Rather, somebody (preferably, one familiar with LOGIC) could have said, """"Bell, how do we know that 'you', 'jimdbell@q.com', is in fact the 'jim bell' (James Dalton Bell) who is the subject of the 'Jim Bell' WP article?  We need to be able to VERIFY the fact that 'jim bell' actually said/did this."""" (To ensure that 'jim bell' is not being libelled by a stealth forgery.)
In response, I would have immediately said, """"Good question!""""  And I could have promptly proceeded to do whatever was necessary to establish this fact.  Perhaps I could also have donated a recent (current!) photograph to the article, which (of course) could be compared with other published (even if not public domain) photographs which are available on the web.   
But as John Belushi was so fond of saying, 'BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO!'  Rather than HELP a 'newbie' (to WP), AND wait for a consensus, and actually help VERIFY that 'jimdbell@q.com' is actually, 'jim bell', Dodo decided to be an ass and repeatedly delete my edits.  And, he deleted ALL my edits, not merely some portion which (allegedly) was not 'verifiable'.  I will give an example, to the contrary:  I also posted a claim that I accused the Feds of forgery in a criminal appeal case, 99-30210.  In fact, in June 2003 I wrote a lawsuit (195 pages) which has (I believe) LONG been posted on the Web.  (Probably Cryptome/JYA).  It (as I recall) makes exactly this accusation.  So, if Dodo had actually acted INTELLIGENTLY, he would have edited my edit to cite my lawsuit, which has been posted for perhaps 5+ years.  (Or, he would have said to me, """"Bell, you need to show a cite of your lawsuit..."""").  THAT would have been productive, useful, and helpful.  (As opposed to being hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.)   So, why didn't Dodo do THAT?!?   The answer is quite simple:  Dodo is hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.  He's a 'control freak'.  (Apparently, WP attracts 'control freaks'.)  Rather than being assisting, supportive, and helpful, Dodo wants to slap around newbies who upset his apple cart.

so far...

CorpseFucking Art (C.F.A.) are an Brutal Death Metal/ deathgrind band, from  Italy formed in 1993. Their lyrics focuses mainly on gore and Humor.

Biography

The band was formed in Rome in 1993. With the first line-up (Max - gurgling, Andrea - guitars, Fabio - bass, Marco - drums) under a different name Enthralment and recorded their first demo called Eulogy Of Burning Christ. The official sound was a slow and brutal death-metal influenced by Immolation and Incantation.

Cryptic Soul Productions signed Enthralment released the 7"""" Accursed In Divinity. However. the sound contained in the new tracks were defenitely more brutal oriented. As the musical direction was no longer the same as the beginning, it was useless to keep the old name. The one choosen for this new form of madness was Corpsegod. With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mini cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mini cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal. Ultrabrutal riffing with techno and industrial parts, splatter movies - Opinion About Sorrow a really vanguard record compared to the others on the death-metal scene.

Though, the passion for the ultrabrutal death-metal in the band was getting higher and higher. The old line-up went to create a new band totally devoted to the brutal death-metal without compromises. A new band was born then, Corpsefucking Art. From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Edo - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-pathic soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut CD named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. An inhuman voice and a blasting riffing made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground.

In 2001 the line-up changed again. Andrea the only member from the first line up joined up with Marco (bass) and Stuart (drums). They recorded a new split CD with Goretrade Zombiecronomicon distributed by Coagulated Records. In april 2002, United Guttural Records took the license by Coagulated records and restamped the split cd with Goretrade, released with a completely new artwork.

After being offered a contract by Forever Underground, Corpsefucking Art entered the studio to record their new full length Splatter Deluxe with the new second guitarist Marco Riccardi. Between the recording and the long wait to the new cd to be out, the band takes part in a lot of live performances including festival in Frankfurt with Lividity, Gorerotted, Inhumate, Pigstry, Nunwhore Commando 666, Mastic Scum, Master and Damnable and the rest of Europe in places like Sweden, France and Italy. The band is currently, in 2008, recording a new studio album and is aspected to come out early 2009.

==Matt Sanchez response, clarifications and demand for apology from Robertissimo

Robertissimo, I beg to differ.  The """"couple of mentions on Fox"""" were full segments on the O'Reilly Factor, a debate on Hannity and Colmes, a full segment on Fox and Friends, a segment on Neil Cavuto and another segment on ABC News, an op-ed in the New York Post and the Marine Corps Post.  I was given the Jeane Kirkpatrick Award principally because I not only defended myself in all these forums, but Iaccording to the award citationupheld a standard of academic freedom in the face of adversity.  I take great issue with your claim of my """" admission in that article that he was also an escort"""".  No such admission was made, i was trying to make a rhetorical comparison between payment for porn as a proxy to a form of prostitution.  I made this point on SEVERAL occasions on the Alan Colmes show.  I was on Alan's show four times.  I take your statement as offensive, cowardly, counter-productive and demand an apology.  I understand that wiki contributors are supposed to be much more subtle in their criticism, however Robertissimosomeone, to my knowledge, that I have never methas shown great disdain for me by publicly calling me a liar, prostitute or worsean imprecise writer.  
If you, Mr Robertissimo hold me in such low regard, why are you interested in contributing to this article?  That's a fair question.  If Mr Robertissimo refuses to apologize, I'd like some advice on how to handle this matter appropriately.  Editors as the faceless Mr Robertissimo should keep in mind that I am a real person and not some """"wiki curiosity"""". 

Robertissimo's comments on the Marine Corps status shows an entire lack of knowledge of these type of procedures, both formal and informal and his assessment is frankly simplistic.  These issues have been discussed ad nauseum, but angry activists still believe they can """"hurt me"""" through this Wikipedia article.  With all due respect to Mr Robertissimo (none of which he has shown me), where did he suddenly come from?    Are we heading back toward editing wars as the dishonest and biased attempt to further their agenda?  Given the history of this article and the number of, frankly, shady characters who have appeared and disappeared on this page, my concerns are merited.  

Out of curiosity, why hasn't any emphasis been placed on """"further investigating"""" the allegations made against me by U-Haul and the Veterans organization? The Marine Corps Times printed the """"allegations"""", but I haven't seen editors on this talk page bringing up that issue.  It is disturbing, distracting and tedious to have to """"defend"""" myself from the likes of character such as Mr. Robertissimo et al...This page was not meant for that purpose and I would like for civility to return.  I fear there has been a further infiltration by former editors who had been resoundingly banned from these pages.  Can anyone comment?
Writing vs. Edits.  I originally cited a comparison between myself and Rich Merritt (who happens to be my neighbor).  I was told the Salon reading audience would not recognize the former pornstar alias USMC Captain Merritt .  The Salon editor, Mark Schone, inserted Jeff Gannon as Mr Gannon is somewhat of a lightrod for the Salon readership's disdain.  I've made this statement before on at least three occasions (please consult the archives).  
In reality, Merritt's story is entirely dissimilar to my own as Merritt was performing in adult films while on active duty. My last film of record was in the winter of '94, nearly a decade before my enlistment in the Marine Corps.  The comparison between myself and Gannon is also passing at best, as Jeff was considered to be a type of interloper/doppleganger with insider knowledge given to him surreptitiously from some shadowy figure/network within the Bush administration or the Republican party.  In my case, there was no doubt of my identity as a Marine, my status as a student at Columbia University, the subsequent changes that were effected in the student and city policy regarding the discrimination of veterans and the specific description of those veterans were all real and documented.  I also had NO inside help or sway with any party or organization, including (unfortunately) the Columbia Milvets organization.  There was never a question that I wrote the articles I wrote, nor was there a hint of some """"higher up"""" working behind the scenes to help me.  There was also never a doubt that I had merited the CPAC Award. I was unanimously elected according to the event's organizers.  I was even congratulated for courage after standing up to the political roasting after unsourced bloggers revealed my past and attempted to link me (rather poorly) with an anti-gay rights agenda.

 Hungary during the Holocaust -The Kastner train 

             The 1955 Kasztner libel case: the verdict of Judge Benjamin Halevi.
The state of Israel claimed that Malkiel Grünwald's allegations against Kasztner were a lie. When Grünwald published these accusations, the Israeli Government did rather more than demand that his views should not be broadcast. Because a prominent Zionist official (Dr. Kastner was a spokesman for the Ministry of Trade and Industry) was involved, the Attorney General of the State of Israel prosecuted Grünwald for criminal libel. Let the verdict of Judge Benjamin Halevi (who later became one of the panel of three judges that tried Eichmann) in Israel's District Court of Jerusalem speak for itself.
The Attorney General v. Malkiel Grünwald
This material should be studied carefully. The masses of Jews from Hungary's ghettos obediently boarded the deportation trains without knowing their fate. They were full of confidence in the false information that they were being transferred to Kenyermeze. The Nazis could not have misled the masses of Jews so conclusively had they not spread their false information through Jewish channels. 
The Jews of the ghettos would not have trusted the Nazi or Hungarian rulers. But they had trust in their Jewish leaders. Eichmann and others used this known fact as part of their calculated plan to mislead the Jews. They were able to deport the Jews to their extermination by the help of Jewish leaders. The false information was spread by the Jewish leaders. The local leaders of the Jews of Kluj and Nodvarod knew that other leaders were spreading such false information and did not protest. Those of the Jews who tried to warn their friends of the truth were persecuted by the Jewish leaders in charge of the local 'rescue work'. The trust of the Jews in the misleading information and their lack of knowledge that their wives, children and themselves were about to be deported to the gas chambers of Auschwitz led the victims to remain quiescent in their ghettos. It seduced them into not resisting or hampering the deportation orders. Dozens of thousands of Jews were guarded in their ghettos by a few dozen police. Yet even vigorous young Jews made no attempt to overpower these few guards and escape to nearby Rumania. No resistance activities to the deportations were organized in these ghettos. And the Jewish leaders did everything in their power to soothe the Jews in the ghettos and to prevent such resistance activities. The same Jews who spread in Kluj and Nodvarod the false rumor of Kenyermeze, or confirmed it, the same public leaders who did not warn their own people against the misleading statements, the same Jewish leaders who did not organize any resistance or any sabotage of deportations . . . these same leaders did not join the people of their community in their ride to Auschwitz, but were all included in the Rescue train. The Nazi organizers of extermination and the perpetrators of extermination permitted Rudolf Kastner and the members of the Jewish Council in Budapest to save themselves, their relatives, and friends. The Nazis did this as a means of making the local Jewish leaders, whom they favoured, dependent on the Nazi regime, dependent on its good will during the time of its fatal deportation schedule. In short, the Nazis succeeded in bringing the Jewish leaders into collaboration with the Nazis at the time of the catastrophe.

The Nazi chiefs knew that the Zionists were a most vital element in Jewry and the most trusted by the Jews. The Nazis drew a lesson from the Warsaw ghetto and other belligerent ghettos. They learned that Jews were able to sell their lives very expensively if honorably guided. Eichmann did not want a second Warsaw. For this reason, the Nazis exerted themselves to mislead and bribe the Jewish leaders. The personality of Rudolph Kastner made him a convenient catspaw for Eichmann and his clique, to draw into collaboration and make their task easier.

The question here is not, as stated by the Attorney General in his summation, whether members of the Jewish Rescue Committee were or were not capable of fulfilling their duty without the patronage of the S.S. chiefs. It is obvious that without such S.S. Nazi patronage the Jewish Rescue Committee could not have existed, and could have acted only as an underground. The question is, as put by the lawyer for the defense, why were the Nazis interested in the existence of the Rescue Committee? Why did the S.S. chiefs make every effort to encourage the existence of the Jewish Rescue Committee? Did the exterminators turn into rescuers?

The same question rises concerning the rescue of prominent Jews by these German killers of Jews. Was the rescue of such Jews a part of the extermination plan of the killers ? The support given by the extermination leaders to Kastner's Rescue Committee proves that indeed there","no you a**hole, i am done with you",3.0,0.0,0.0

 Lasvegasflash ban 

Just a few comments on this action.
First let's say I have been in this guy's boots. Admins start revertinng your edits with no explanation and no explanation of who they are or their capabilities. After participating in other forums and various social activities around the Internet one learns to just ignore this as crap and trolls wanting to exert their ego trips on you. You removed the history of the warning revision summary on his talk page but after reviewing the talk page revisions, I think I understand what may have happened. I sympathise for the guy as I have been there myself and with one of the same personalities involved, too. I would guess he (LasVegasflash) thought he was doing a good thing for wikipedia and did not understand why his links were considered spam and everybody else's were good. Then enter a few editors with histories of kicking people, not summary commenting with any details, and then he, either becomes defiant, or just ignores the """"trolls"""" harrassing him. Sound familiar from other kicked editors?

Admins need to identify themselves!!!

My feeling is the permanent ban was too harsh. Review his edits. He has contributed a fair bit of information and time. This demonstrates caring from the guy. He just seems ignorant and needs a lesson from somebody. This won't be the first time I have been harrassed or banned from attempted compassion....LOL. Your call. I am a newbie.
Best of luck. 99.251.114.120  """,""", I concur with White Guard that Lenin and his government committed many atrocities against the Russian people, and your attempt to 'whitewash' their reputation is somewhat historically inaccurate (please don't take this as a personal attack). As for the kulaks, you're perfectly correct that they never really existed as a class, and were invented by the Communists as an attempt to encourage 'class warfare' in the countryside - yet you choose to ignore the fact that it was Lenin, not Stalin, who began the campaign against the kulaks. It was, admittedly, Stalin who was responsible for the wholesale purging of kulaks as part of his collectivisation programme. Overall, I would say Stalin took Lenin's ideology to new heights of paranoia and mass murder - but the foundations of this ideology were all in the system that Lenin established. Stalin was worse than Lenin, but there wasn't a clean historical break between the two - they were part of the same authoritarian and brutal Communist tradition.  

 What Is To be Done?-Part III 

Further remarks are obviously required.

ANTI-SEMITISM.  Could I please have a reference for Nicholas' authorisation of the Kishinev massacre?  As far as I am aware this episode was the handiwork of Vyacheslav Plehve, minister of the interior and a notorious anti-semite.  The pogrom was condemned by the governor of Bessarabia and by the central government.  Sergius Witte, by far the Tsar's best minister, made his own feelings on the matter plain.  

There were pogroms in Tsarist Russia, and anti-semitism was a long-established and poisonous tradition.  The point is that this cannot always be traced back to the Tsar: Russian state and government was far too complex for that.  Official anti-semitism was, moreover, of a confessional rather than a biological nature.  Under Alexander III the drive for assimiliation became ever greater, after the murder of his liberal-minded father, but it also affected Catholics, Lutherans and Muslims, as well as Jews.  Civil disabilities could always be lifted for converts to Orthodoxy, for those who were minded to take this path.  

Nicholas was a conventional and unimaginitive man, but even he could detect the patently false.
Although he was initially taken in by the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (as was the London Times in 1919) he soon recognised them, according to Vladimir Burtsev, no friend of the Tsar, as dangerous political nonsense.  You may care to consult Solomon Grayzel, again no admirer of Tsarist Russia, who in his A History of the Jews says """"Even the Tsar had considered the forgery utterly improbable and unworthy of consideration."""" (Philadelphia, 1968, p. 613).  

Now, this whole debate arose because I questioned Lenin's credentials as a campaigner against anti-semitism on the basis of a single speech with no examples provided.  If we look at the actual record of Soviet Russia under Lenin a quite different picture emerges.  The age-old antisemitism of the Tsars showed little sign of going away; if anything, it got worse.  Red army units were amongst those responsible for pogroms in the Ukraine, to the obvious disquiet of Trotsky.  During the 1921 campaign against religion, specifically authorised by Lenin, the Jews were singled out as a special target; even Maxim Gorky accused the government of using anti-semitism for political purposes.  There were pogroms in Smolensk and other places.  When Jewish people tried to defend their synagogues, threatened with confiscation, troops broke in, shouting 'Death to the Yids' in the process.  The campaign of 1921 peaked in the mock trial of 'Judaism', carried out, for additionl emphasis, if any such was needed, in the very same courtroom as the Beiliss trial of 1913.  What price Lenin's support for the Jews?

TERROR.  Yes, there was terror, extensive and brutal; but that of the Whites was more than matched by that of the Reds, and not just against counter-revolutionaries but peope who had been their allies and comrades in the political underground.  By 1921, well after the White threat had gone away, oppression and terror had become a fact of life in the 'worker's fatherland'.  It never went away. 

Let me make it plain that I am simpy asking that this article reflects the true facts of Lenin's career.  As it stands at present it is little more than a biased 'appreciation.'

 Let me add a comment here in this discussion.  While it certainly seems strange that jokes are included on a page concerning 'religion', dismissing it completely without some discussion and consideration would be doing a disservice.  It may very well be that Bektashi culture is intimately tied to a rich collection of jokes which serve some pedagogical role in the religion.  For example, if we look at this site:
 http://www.alevibektasi.org/xalevis1.htm
 It is written that 
""""X. Alevi-Bektashi Humor
Alevis and Bektashis love to use humor to mock religious legalism, hypocrisy, and those who they feel have persecuted them. This humor reveals much about Alevi-Bektashi thought. To understand their humor is to understand the Alevi-Bektashis’ approach to life, religion, and their place in society. Here are only a few examples of the hundreds of Bektashi jokes (fıkralar) that have been collected.

 The author is John Shindeldecker, and he is listed as one of the researchers on the fairly official-looking homepage 
 http://www.alevibektasi.org/makale_engl.htm
 In this case, this material suggests that humor is an integral part of defining Bektashi culture as distinctive from other factions of Islam.  Much as Zen Buddhism is characterized by the sometimes meaningless Koans or Gospel music in certain factions of Protestant Christianity.  In all of these cases, I don't think it's fair to say that it's like """"adding black jokes to an article about African Americans.""""  This comparison is also a bit overreaching, and unwarranted.  AldirmaGonul has made a good faith case for why the jokes should be placed on this page.  freestylefrappe has deleted it by only saying that it's """"suspect"""" and """"racist"""".

The exact sentence is: Masonic conspiracy theories are a subset of conspiracy theories involving Freemasonry.

 New 2012 study by Mark Regnerus, sociology professor at the University of Texas 

A new study conducted by Mark Regnerus, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas has revealed, among other things, that 40% of children (aged 18 to 39) whose parents are homosexual have had an affair while married or cohabiting, compared to only 13% of children from heterosexual families. It also showed that 23% of children whose parents are lesbian or gay have been touched sexually by a parent or an adult, compared to 2% of children from heterosexual families, and that 31% of them have had sex against their will, compared to 8% from heterosexual families. The study stresses, however, that it would be wrong to conclude from its data that the abuser was necessarily one of the parents, or that the abuse had anything to do with the parent's sexual orientation. The study also shows that 12% of those with lesbian parents and 24% of those with homosexual fathers have considered suicide, compared to 5% of those from heterosexual families. Children with homosexual parents are also more than twice as likely to be in therapy """"for a problem connected with anxiety, depression or relationships"""" - 19% of children compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Furthermore, 20% of children with lesbian parents and 25% of children with homosexual fathers have had a sexually transmitted disease, compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. 28% of children with lesbian parents and 20% of children with homosexual fathers are currently unemployed compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Adult children with homosexual parents are also more likely to smoke marijuana and to get arrested.

 On the goodness of description and evil of prescription 

The article on grammar suggests in many ways that teaching people how to listen and read is good, but teaching them how to speak and write is wicked. Linguists are said to be concerned """"normally"""" with the former, implying that there is something abnormal about the latter. The notion that we are all culpable when helping people decide how to communicate, when seeking such help, and when making such decisions ourselves, is not only perverse and deplorable, but also patently wrong. We begin our lives incapable of speech. Is it wrong to acquire the ability? Is it right to call instruction in the application of the rules of grammar an invalid activity? Banning prescriptive grammar from the general article on grammar and suggesting that it is illegitimate are serious mistakes, motivated, I suspect, by timidity, laziness, irresponsibility, and ignorance.

 Perspective? 
""""In the trial Shylock represents the Jewish side in contrast to the Christian one in a matter of highest importance: Justice (Jewish, Old Testament) is confronted with Mercy (Christian, New Testament). In the Christian view mercy is the decisive step after justice is reached. Therefore the Christians in the courtroom urge mercy. Beside the fact, that Shylock as a Jew is not in duty to give mercy, he is not able as well, because for this you need love. He doesn't find love at all, but hate. Shakespeare explains this in Shylock's monologue very clearly. To be merciful despite the hate nevertheless you have to love your enemy (New Testament). That means in fact that the Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to behave like a very true Christian by loving his enemies although they themselves failed even in loving just their neighbours (the Jews) in the past before.""""

 Recent page moves (see also: unresolved discussion above regarding this issue) 
OK  I don't understand why this is an issue, unless you all figure that this article deserves some sort-of 'special exception' to Wikipedia's rules of article naming and precedent. If so inclined, click: French Jews, German Jews, Russian Jews, and so forth on in to perpetuity. ALL of these names REDIRECT to the """"History of the Jews in [country]"""" articles, i.e. they DO NOT have their own special article on this topic (even though, for whatever reason, THIS page on """"Jews and Judaism in the United States"""" IS indeed a separate entity from the """"History of the Jews in the United States"""" page, not to mention separate from the Lists of American Jews [also wrong titled, differs from category name], and separate from Category:Jewish Americans [correct category name]). DO YOU ALL NOW SEE WHAT A COMPLETE AND UTTER MESS YOU HAVE MADE OF THESE JEWS AND JUDAISM RELATED AMERICAN ARTICLES AND CATEGORIES because of all of the wayward and entirely unneeded article/category moves and counter-moves, renames and counter-renames?  I merely seek to fix (standardize) all of this, nothing more.  Please help me to do this, and please stop engaging in these senseless/childish edit wars and continuing to revert and/or disregard my good moves and valid information.

There are many article/category naming irregularities still out there (found in Judaism by country [maybe we start there?] such as Italian Jews, but I'm about to fix that), but we need to stick to ONE naming scheme for ALL Jewish articles, and so far the category naming scheme """"Jews and Judaism in [country]"""" (as opposed to """"History of the Jews in [country]"""") is the most widespread and used, thus it can be regarded as a precedent (or is one used for the category, one for the actual article?). The confusing part is that, like I just hinted at, in some cases we have """"History of the Jews in [country]"""" pages, along with """"Jews and Judaism in [country]"""" pages (plus tons of categories with same name, which User:IZAK has been standardizing to some extent), along with the list articles like List of German Jews, List of British Jews, and so forth. So, maybe we need to start a discussion and approve a policy of article name STANDARDIZATION and PRECEDENT than can be followed in the future as they relate to ALL of these disparate yet related pages (Jews/Judaism in [country], History of Jews in [country], List of [national] Jews, all related to the standard category naming scheme """"Jews and Judaism in [country]""""). Per User:IZAK's recent moves involving the Swiss and Norwegian Jew articles I thought that this was and has been the accepted norm/precedent, but now I am being reverted for moving this article to its similar name, yet of course no one objects to IZAK's moves at all. If I am doing something wrong here, by all means please let me know  however, I am just trying to improve the overall naming and organizational scheme of this article and indeed all of the Category:Jews and Judaism by country (Judaism by country) articles/categories as a whole.

Also...Jayjg, why do you keep reverting the List of Jewish Americans to List of American Jews even though ALL of the actual lists found in that master list are still named """"List of Jewish American [profession]"""" as they should be, a hold-over from the olden days when these article/category names weren't in such a state of disorganization and disarray?

 Response to Your defence of LGagnon.

At the Ayn Rand Talk Page you will find evidence of my attempts to talk to Lgagnon. Just infra I post here a copy of my Memo to the Wikipedia Board articulating my frustration in this regard.

I continue to have problems with LGagnon at Wikipedia. He sends me the most ill-written messages. It is almost impossible to wade through the bad grammar, misspellings/typos; etc to get his point. He indulges the most foul personal attacks with regard to everyone, even Wikipedia admins, referring to the latter as """"vandal-coddling."""" He never backs up his unthinking assertions. He simply asserts.

Why does Wikipedia continue to indulge one  but one  lamentably under-educated vulgarian in this regard, to this degree? What could possibly be the explanation????!!!!!!!!

You quickly forget that I am objecting to the MISINTERPRETATION of a 'rule', and the MISAPPLICATION of a 'rule'.   (or, do you not concede that, hypothetically, a VALID, proper rule can be MISINTERPRETED and/or MISAPPLIED?).  Merely citing the RULE is pointless, when the problem is the misinterpretation or misapplication of the rule!
 Further, Dodo violated WP rules, by not allowing a consensus of the group to develop.  He also misapplied a rule, claiming that something I said must be 'verifiable'.  But what does it mean, to be 'verified'?  Dodo implied that what I said must be verifiably, scientifically TRUE.  I claim, quite to the contrary, that since the article involved is 'Jim Bell' (subject, ME), that the only 'verifiability' issue is this:  Did 'James Dalton Bell' ACTUALLY make these claims.  (Or, conversely and hypothetically, 'is someone else forging his identity?, etc.)   For example, there was no need to RUSH and delete my posts.  Rather, somebody (preferably, one familiar with LOGIC) could have said, """"Bell, how do we know that 'you', 'jimdbell@q.com', is in fact the 'jim bell' (James Dalton Bell) who is the subject of the 'Jim Bell' WP article?  We need to be able to VERIFY the fact that 'jim bell' actually said/did this."""" (To ensure that 'jim bell' is not being libelled by a stealth forgery.)
In response, I would have immediately said, """"Good question!""""  And I could have promptly proceeded to do whatever was necessary to establish this fact.  Perhaps I could also have donated a recent (current!) photograph to the article, which (of course) could be compared with other published (even if not public domain) photographs which are available on the web.   
But as John Belushi was so fond of saying, 'BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO!'  Rather than HELP a 'newbie' (to WP), AND wait for a consensus, and actually help VERIFY that 'jimdbell@q.com' is actually, 'jim bell', Dodo decided to be an ass and repeatedly delete my edits.  And, he deleted ALL my edits, not merely some portion which (allegedly) was not 'verifiable'.  I will give an example, to the contrary:  I also posted a claim that I accused the Feds of forgery in a criminal appeal case, 99-30210.  In fact, in June 2003 I wrote a lawsuit (195 pages) which has (I believe) LONG been posted on the Web.  (Probably Cryptome/JYA).  It (as I recall) makes exactly this accusation.  So, if Dodo had actually acted INTELLIGENTLY, he would have edited my edit to cite my lawsuit, which has been posted for perhaps 5+ years.  (Or, he would have said to me, """"Bell, you need to show a cite of your lawsuit..."""").  THAT would have been productive, useful, and helpful.  (As opposed to being hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.)   So, why didn't Dodo do THAT?!?   The answer is quite simple:  Dodo is hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.  He's a 'control freak'.  (Apparently, WP attracts 'control freaks'.)  Rather than being assisting, supportive, and helpful, Dodo wants to slap around newbies who upset his apple cart.

 Rothwell struggles in vain to withdraw from Wikipedia 

This is somewhat off topic, but I was surprised to discover that a person is not allowed to withdraw from Wikipedia or delete the contents of his own talk page. Apparently it is cybernetic tar pit.

Had I know it was against the rules to erase one's own talk page, I never would have talked there, since I frequently use it for things like unfinished manuscripts (which have embarrassing errors), jokes and so on, which were never intended to be permanent. Anyway, for the past day or so I have been trying to erase these comments without success. One of the Sysops here, Mr. Connolley apparently wishes to preserve this page because it includes proof that I have committed an egregious violation of the rules, by calling someone: “childish, boorish, pig headed [and] unreasonable” and earlier “an insufferable ninny.” The poor fellow was so overcome by grief & consternation, he felt compelled to report this outrage to the authorities. (I might also call him a crybaby or a tattletale, but he would die of shock. I have done enough damage already; I fear he may need long-term therapy.)

Anyway, I was banned for this unspeakable language, and Connelley will not even allow me to purge the evidence of my shame. I changed my description page and sent a message to Connelley with damning evidence for him to use in place of my talk page. I fear he may revert both, and delete this message, but before he does readers here may be amused by the new text here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JedRothwell I quote Schiller's warning: """"Mit der Dummheit kaempfen Goetter selbst vergebens."""" ('Against stupidity the gods themselves struggle in vain.') (Maid of Orleans, act 3, sc. 6). Hence, the title of this message.

Thick-skinned readers here might also enjoy the egregious replacement insult I sent to Connelly:

. . . If you would like a reason to block me, or prove that I have violated the rules, you need not preserve the talk page. Here is another deliberate & intentionally provocative violation of the rules  an old-school personal insult:

You are a loathsome, sanctimonious, hypocritical, ignorant twit. If you were in state of uncontrolled combustion, I would not take the trouble to extinguish the flames by urinating on them.

 Russian Jewish immigrants """"seeking renewed contact with their Jewish heritage"""" 

 The influx of refugees, many of them seeking renewed contact with their Jewish heritage, has led to a renaissance of Jewish life on German soil. 

Although this sounds very nice, this is just wishfull-thinking and a lack of knowlegde of the reallity of the russian-jewish german immigration.

To further explain my point, I'll use a bit from the Germany Talk page:

..., that during the last years more Jews prefered emigrating to Germany than to Israel as they, usually Ashkenazies, feel much closer to Germany and the German language (Yiddish is a Germanic language) than to Israel. The Hebrew language is too much different from Yiddish and Israel is a Mideast nation in a conflictive area, so an increasing number of Ashkenazies prefer emigrating to Germany where they feel more integrated

These kind of comments and insights are simply not true, are totally away from reality and show a profound lack of knowledge of current german/jewish life.

Good and reputable sources on this matter are abundant. I would suggest that you first start by readind the """"Juedische Allgemeine"""" Germany's (internationally aclaimed) leading daily newspapers devoted to the jewish community. You'll find there lots of insights, analysis, studies, newsreports, and this will help you a lot to understand the reality of the Russian-Jewish post 90's emigration to Germany. Furthermore the german government policies, decisions and the impacto on german society have also been thouroughly  described, analysed and commentated on the main media press (Spiegel, etc) easly. 

more Jews prefered emigrating to Germany than to Israel or feel much closer to Germany

The reason number one for this preference is the exceptionally conditions (read money) that this german post-berlin-wall policy entitles them to. (much to the critic of the Israeli Governement)

Most of Russian who came, would never have left the ex Soviet Union, if it wasnt for this special german policy and the catastrophic collapse of pensions and social security in Russia. Not to Israel, not to anywhere. So it is incorrect to say """"preferred"""". They just grabbed the opportunity. They neither feel closer to Germany nor to Israel.

The issue of the """"renaissance"""" with integration and participation of the """"russian jews"""" in the german jewish community, their clashes and success stories is a well documented (and problematic one). Again, read the german (jewish and non jewish ) newspapers.

In their vast majority they were already above 50 when they arrived in Germany, and I would not say that their connection with judaism was/is """"that big"""".

PROPOSED ADDITION:

Because interracial rape is now overwhelmingly black on white, it has become difficult to do research on it or to find relevant statistics. The FBI keeps very detailed national records on crime, but the way it presents rape data obscures the racial element rather than clarifies it. Dr. William Wilbanks, a criminologist at Florida International University, had to sift carefully through the data to find that in 1988 there were 9,406 cases of black-on-white rape and fewer than ten cases of white-on-black rape.

 This needs fixing and I mean NOW 

This article is very poorly done for one reason: there is no such thing as the Seven Laws of Noah. If anyone would care to read any version of the Book of Genesis (Bereishit), starting at chapter 9, the laws which Noah was given and the laws he already lived are clearly indicated. They are not seven mitzvot- I counted nine myself, and only one matches the alleged Seven Laws (not to eat bloody flesh or vivsect an animal).

For example, the first I counted was """"...be fruitful and multiply..."""". Does anyone see that as a Sheva Motzvot? I don't! Now, I can see this entry wishes to concentrate on Noahides and Noahidism; it's very fair and noble. But PLEASE consult the rabbis who clearly state as does the Bible that no such laws exist! No such laws are expounded upon, or even mentioned, in Genesis.

It is most especially important that this article try to move away with impartiality from the Jewish viewpoint. Gentiles do not have to obey rabbis or follow Jewish beliefs or extrapolations of Jewish halachah. Since the Laws of Noah were concocted, claiming Biblical authority by the Hasidim, this is a violation on their part. According to Jewish teaching, a Jew must not and cannot force a Gentile to do or accept anything!

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.","Troll

 Warren Commission Exhibit 746-E  the """"Chin"""" 

It is time to confront the problem. Is the incriminating photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald a fabrication or not?  There is Oswald hold the rifle that blew the head off of JFK. And Oswald is carrying a pistol on his hip, perhaps the very one that was used to shoot the police officer named Officer Tippit. Not only that, Oswald has in his hands what people claim is left wing literature. 

The police found the picture immediately. Since the picture tied Oswald to the murder weapon, the police confronted Oswald with the picture right away. Oswald looked at the picture and threw cold water on the evidence that seemingly tied him to the murder weapon. 

Oswald, who some believe is a lying little rat,  said words to the effect: """"That's not me holding that rifle. Someone pasted my face on someone else's body.""""

 You People... 
...Are hoping, begging and wishing for previlages, respect a title that you did not earn, go by on your own and are not deserving of.  You did not build the US, you had the Spanish Empire and it failed, not you come here by crossing the border and by boat.  Stop fooling yourselves.  BEFORE the first Spanird came to the Americas, they already had black blood and Asian blood in them!  This is why they are darker.  This is why on the paintings from the Colombua period they had yelolow hues, dark hair, curly hair and full lips.  Yeah, Isabella was red, but Spaniards were never one type of European to begin with.  On top of that, as the Moors got defeated (not actually kicked out of Spain altogether), more Europeans came into the mix and reintroduced whiteness.  NOW, the mulattoized peoples still remained as it is today, especially in Portugal, France and Italy.

Once the Spaniards came over here, mixing was let loose, UNLIKE the rule in the USA!  See, the US was operating on whiteness and a white 'purity' concept.  You guys were operating on being greedy and grabbing land and not knowing what to do with it.  You mixed with the natives and the Africans.  It is more than clear.  In fact, it is so clear that that is all you see.  Only after the US established itself as THE word power (and broke down Spain's empire.  How come they did not do it to France..?), THEN you people started trying to think of yourselves as white.  That only increased as you immigrated to the US and it broke your hearts when you found out that you were not white and landed in the ghetto.

If you sad mixed people don't get it by now - AMerica does not settle for mixes or those who cry about being white, you are or you are not.  If you have noticed in US history and society in general, Spain and Portugal are hardly if ever mentioned in a context with Europe.  You ask the average American where Portugal is they can't tell you.  They may have heard of some people (usually black) calling themselves Portuguese, but have no idea where or what Portugal is.  Spain less so, but white is not associated with Spain.  Even Europe is hardly associated with Spain.

All of this BS about you guys being more pure than American whites is just that - BS.  People know that you are hispanic.  You don't - you can't fool anyone.  Only very few of you look like a 'no questions asked' white person.  I can understand your pain, since many Greeks and Italians are regarded (not exactly accepted) as white, even though clear non-European/African traits are visible.  I guess you would ask """"if they can be white, then why should I not be?""""  Good question, but you people are not doubt mixed and recently.  Italians and Greeks may not have a direct black parent, but you can look at them and see that African beneath the surface.  Some African is on the surface more than the white is!  

Sadly (for those of you with white dreams that is), you are lumped together with the rest of your latino brothers.  Just because things are not going well n ALL of those (so much land and resources) countries, you want to come to the US and get a free ride as whites?  It does not work as easily for you as it may work for others.  One, you ARE NOT coming from Europe, so there is no built-n perception of whiteness based on Europe alone.  Two, you are mixed!  You need to review the history of the US!  Once you do (the 20th century alone will do), you will see that you need not apply as white.  Only the absolute whitest (dying your hair blond or red does not fool anyone for your information) need apply.  You just can't come to a country and get a free ride.  You have ALL of Latin America, instead of making something out of that, you want to come here and try and be white.  No, no.

I still cannot believe how many Puerto-Ricans, Dominicans, Chileans, Argentines and so on truly believe themselves to be white.  I met a femle who thinks she is white.  I keep telling her it is only in her world because it is not in anyone elses.  Spain IS in Europe, but despite popular thought, not all Europeans are white.  You can do your best to lie about the Moors, lies about African savery in Latin America and lie that there was even race-mixing going on, it does not change history and biolgy.

Also, I was already well aware of the hispanic trick of calling white people Anglos, meaning """"your type of whites as opposed to my type"""" which whites don't care about.  You are not seen as white, you are seen as hispanics.  This is why you are (along with Italians and other black mixed Europeans)quick to (try) and be 'racist'(renegade mulatto is more like it) against blacks, thinking that it pleased whites and that it somehow makes you feel white in your mind.  Being white does not mean being a racist.  White is an American (USA) thing.  Most Europeans never thought of themselves as beinga part of a white people.","ATTENTION!!!

 Your edits to Marcus Hahnemann 

Okay, examples:
For the piping of club names, check any other football bio page, e.g. Theo Walcott, Brian McBride, Wayne Rooney, Alan Shearer.
For the formatting of dates in the infobox, check the guidelines at Template talk:Infobox Football biography.  You should be using five tildes (i.e. """"~~~~~"""") to produce the timestamp.
For your other edit, how does """"English FA Premier League"""" even make sense?  Either call it the English Premier League, or call it the FA Premier League, but to call it both in the same sentence is nonsensical!

Please do some research in future before trying to change the style on an article.    
For the piping, the convention is meaningless, as the name of the club includes the initials. The fact that some other articles use your conventions does not mean anything, other articles use mine. So it is a matter of meaning, and I still think mine has more sense.

The article below describes how the cham were expelled by the greek.

 Napoleon Zervas 

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed",I decided to cut my vacation a bit short. Due to heavy snowing I am stranded so I will be bored. Dont get me wrong I am still a bit nuts... Talk|@ ,2.0,1.0,0.3333333333333333

Talk by definition is seen in the following example: I go on your article under edit write Oh! this is a great article you must read it, Blah, Blah, Blah, ect. Vandalism is malicious, willfully destruction of public, or personal property, such as windows of a building, or a historical document, not an article. But, if you want to stretch the word to cover your criminal article(an article whose intent is to past along only half the story, which is half the truth, which is a lie, which is given to deceive and to harm individuals reading the article hoping to be FULLY informed, Not half informed, this is seen by you trying to hide the truth that stays in the framework (intent and purpose) of the article, and completes the article. This is a criminal act of fraud, and the damage done to people's personal property, i.e. their computers, is the criminal act of vandalism. All is done through, and by, your article by hiding the truth, and giving only half the story that does not stay in the intent and purpose of the article, i.e. to fully inform the public of the versions of Firefox)this then would be the example I write in your article that it is crap, bogus. that people should not read it.

These people cannot afford computer tech to service their computers, they have to """"rely on the kindness of strangers"""", such as volunteers such as myself. Some do not have a network of tech volunteers, so your article causes them suffering by hiding the truth from them (by removal of any information that shows the serious flaws of those versions so that it is never seen and the people are not informed), and by not having the money, or the means to correct it, and taking what little pleasure and escape from them. For this act the courts should pass the harshest and heaviest sentence possible on you, and others like you. I hope in the near future that not only that you are arrested, tried, and imprisoned, but you are sued and lose everything you have, everything you have striven for, and everything you have dreamed about.

Okay with regards to that last little comment: How about you try choking on my balls you over 
excitable ancient. Forgive my antagonism but I give only as much as I receive, and I have most 
certainly received a substantial quantity from you. You may try to come across as a cool headed and fair moderator. In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are). Without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you can't verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be. And what of those whose revisions you've mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. I will admit to you that I have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making. I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am. If you can recall (Of this there is little hope) you once likened my writing to that found in """"chat-rooms"""" and believe me when I say I did not LOL over that comment. I was at the time of our encounter studying a BA with a major in Creative English Writing. You should note before you jump to the conclusion that I dropped out as I suspect you would in your typical """"angry"""" way: not only have I graduated, I continued my study for a further year and obtained honors. I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22. It is your obsession with reversion resulting I must assume in a complete disregard of duty to family or perhaps a complete disconnection from the living world, I say again it is this obsession which keeps this website from being everything it should be. Thank for your tireless efforts. Thank for your senseless, heartless, worthless, and above all tireless efforts. I really do hate you.""","OH, GET REAL, WILL YA'!! (or, is THAT a totally alien-concept for you??)...

These are not 'angry' - you DO NOT want to see me angry... AGAIN, THESE ARE ALL STATEMENTS OF FACT, WHICH FALLS [SOLIDLY] WITHIN MY 1ST AMMENDMENT RIGHTS. 

Additionally, I DO HAVE MY OWN WEBSITES - SEVERAL OF THEM - AND THERE ARE OTHERS ABOUT ME BUILT BY FANS I'VE NEVER EVEN PHYSICALLY MET... Once more the mark of someone 'wet behind their ears' and not willing to do the research... I GUESS everything that is required of a 'good' editor/administrator, HERE.

I've had this same problem with the 'Wiki' bastards in Australia... Spouting revisionist history, and trying to tell ME that I never did the things that I actually did, and pronouncing 'harsh-judgment'/condemnation on the things I DIDN'T...

What the hell is the matter with you 'types'? (rhetorical, actually)... Because I already know: You hide behind 'avatars' and sit on your 'high-and-mighty-thrones' to try and dictate to other people about THEIR OWN LIVES... Politically, you're VERY likely LIBERAL, and ethically/morally, quite obviously BANKRUPT! In short, individuals of your 'persuasion' cannot make it in the outside world, so you 'bury' & 'busy' yourselves in 'safe' [for you] places like this, where you can exert an imagined 'power' over others and their lives, through KEYSTROKE TERROISM - THAT'S WHAT IT AMOUNTS-TO... I'M NOT THE DANGER/THREAT WITH THESE MESSAGES,  BECAUSE I'M OUT HERE AND PUBLIC... BUT YOU ARE, BECAUSE YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND ALL OF THIS, SO YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE PROTECTED, AND CAN STRIKE OUT AT PEOPLE WITH 'IMPUNITY'... BUT, YOU REALLY CANNOT. I FEEL SAD FOR YOU... YEAH, RIGHT!! 

Well, I'm going to be the 'bigger man' here (even though I believe it said YOU were some kinda' editor CHICK)... I'll leave you to do what you want in your own, lil' limited SANDBOX, and I'll just go about my usual business - IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD; THE REAL WORLD! - where what is accomplished really matters, is truly appreciated, and people actually give a good, god-damn about accuracy and the true efficacy of all their hard-fought-for efforts.

I wish you well... I'd wish your 'husband' well, also, although I doubt that you have one... for the above, obvious reasons cited - and IF ya' ever did [ya' sweet, lil' monkey you], he likely 'BOLTED' long ago... either that, or ya' probably 'edited' his ass out of existence TOO!

Poor Guy... Oh well...

Due to things off my hands, (appointments, car broken, my neighbor is not legal so she chose not to go because Arpaio allegedly threatened to arrest illegals, only small groups gathered here) and just plain bad luck I wasn;'t able to march but I protested too, wearing White that day and resisting my ever attacking urges to shop and shop, which are like the munchies to me. Today Im already looking forward to what Im gonna buy tonight..lol!!

Anyways, banderas arriba!! We gotta peacefully fight the racists, show them we are here to stay.

And that's where you get into the whole WP:Crystal argument, which I can't even get an acceptable answer with on the help desk.  I am not going to have someone else's reality enforced upon me, on Wikipedia or anyplace else.  If that's a problem, have me blocked or banned and do it quickly!  The character of Daniel Bryan, the moment he declared intention, put that match on the card.  If that intention (see Kennedy-Edge) changes, WE CAN REMOVE IT LATER!  The only reason the WWE announced Rock-Cena, and you still need to source """"out of story"""" announcement in that regard, is because the character of The Rock and the character of John Cena stated the very same level of intention to face each other at Wrestlemania.  Or is it the fact that you (collectively) believe Daniel Bryan is scum and that the position of The Rock and Cena as legends gives them the right to impose that reality that Bryan has not and will never have earned?  And, as for the Triple Threat option  very correct  same thing, WE CAN CHANGE IT LATER WHEN IT HAPPENS.  Another option already proposed is that the Royal Rumble winner would face the WHC, and THEN Bryan cashes in.  But what level of intention breaks WP:Crystal?

Answer to Mütze
Well, I am surprised to see that I am unblocked! At least, you still have seen that you targeted the wrong person for the wrong reasons!!

Mütze, I have used this Wikipedia for only a few days but I am still not an idiot. Of course, what I say further below on what I think you did is an assumption but I believe a very good one! Here is what you did. You saw the following I posted on the Bosendorfer discussion page:
""""Very soon, this article will be published and you will have to leave it this way; otherwise, the censors at Wikipedia will be forced to side with me (!!) considering the fact that I gave you the opportunity to challenge what I wrote in my article."""".

As you clearly told me yourself, you did not want my article to be published. This quote clearly threatened you because I told taht I will soon publish my article and it will be with the full support of everybody because I used the discussion page of Bosendorfer. You then contacted Andrew Norman to block me to prevent me from editing the Bosendorfer discussion page and then you thought you could keep me away on my own user page with the intention of blocking me indefinitively. When you blocked me indefinitively through RobertG, you knew too well that no one could read my user page afterward! That is what I believe you did! And it is probably easily verifiable by people at Wikipedia.

Now, what is your role at Wikipedia? You are not an administrator; otherwise you would have blocked me yourself directly!

Anyway, I propose to carry on the discussion on the Bosendorfer discussion page concerning my article. I am ready to change sentences that cause problems. It is just up to you to mention these problematic sentences on this Bosendorfer discussion page and if you have a valid reason to have this sentence changed, it will be changed. I am not a fanatic and I am ready to please people. I will use logic and reason to assess a request to change sentences, not emotions. If I do not want to change a sentence, I will say clearly why and we could discuss further on this refusal to accept a change if it happens.

And I will answer the points you raised in your previous postings, Mütze.

So, I hope you will behave a little bit more relaxed about what I intend to do. The goal: publish a good article on a good product that inform people who read it. Apparently, for the time being, mostly the group of administrators and their friends (!!) who are the only ones who complained about my article so far.

But to have had to go through such a nightmare just to want to publish a good article on Wikipedia is surely not the right way to do at Wikipedia with people who are ready to contribute positively!! You are really going to put people off wanting to write on Wikipedia! And I especially target the administrators who have been in contact with me in a very aggressive way. Just a few days ago, I did not even know that what an administrator was at Wikipedia!

Here is what Jimbo Wales says on his user page:
""""Newcomers are always to be welcomed. There must be no cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers."""".
If he knews what I had to go through and the very aggressive behaviour I experienced from administrators at Wikipedia, he would not be very pleased. What I say above, he call it one of his main principles!

So, administrators, when you contact people, make sure you remember this very core principle of one of the founders of Wikipedia and target the true vandals instead of people like me who are willing to add a good article to Wikipedia!

Jimbo Wales wants people to write as many articles as possible on Wikipedia. Your role as administrators is to help and encourage them to do so instead of trying to block them indefinitively!

So, I hope you can now all relax and not get emotional or upset on this coming article. I follow the process used by Wikipedia to deal with an article that causes opposition. See the new comments now on the Bosendorfer discussion page and state the sentences that cause you problems and especially why these sentences are problematic. Then, I will do my best to change them to please everybody.

Chip killed Ciji, but Val confessed because Gary was arrested and tried for the crime.        bon giorno #c ""","Kristof the problem here is a lag from the old Ukrainian orthography that has since changed. A similar case existed in Belarus, but much more amplified, when the changes of 1930s and subsequent orthographic reforms were very noticeable it affected the way whole cities were spelled. Example Minsk and Mensk. In fact that is the reason why there are two versions of Belarusian edition wikipedia, one uses the old and the other the official adopted version. In Ukrainian language a similar happened but to lesser extent, and only some cities were affected e.g. Rivne became Rovno, Luhanske became Luhansk, Konotip became Konotop and so on. With our city as far as I am aware it too became Мукачево. During the 1990s some of those changes were reversed, and it really falls to because in Ukrainian there are sufficient differences between dialects, in fact if you compare western and central Ukrainian the differences would be more vivid than that of British and American English. So for some cases like Rivne, it was much up to the locals, because Volhynian dialect pronounces the city like its spelled, whilst somewhere in Poltava they will say it as Rovno. It seems that with Mukhachevo it is a case that the version used by locals is not entirely adopted nationwide. But then again there are some silly people in the government who use spellings such as Sevatopil but that is outright stupid, because even in classic orthography that version would never be used. The -pil originates from the connotation of field like Ternopil. The -pol comes from the Greek root for city, like Sevastopol. All the more reasons why we should stick to Mukachevo and help to leave the archaic spelling where it belongs in history.  ",1.0,2.0,0.3333333333333333

I and I alone provided for mankind the most powerful machine since the dawn of time. I was foolish to think I'd get a meeting with the president or the Nobel peace prize. I guess I had my little finger cocked the wrong political way when I did it. Since this was known the forces that be have turned their evil cannons of jealousy toward me and ignored every rule in the book, played every unfair card in the book known and made as many unfair ones they could get their hands on to destroy me and steal it and gain credit for themselves on it. You have to decide if you are on the side of truth and life that I intended for this technology to bring or allow those lord high felons to destroy me with unfair and unequally applied rules. Are you going to be a part of that? Why do I say this? Because if I don't stand no honest person will forever thereafter. Have Wikipedia editors blocked William R. Buckley for the admitted first attack here and thereafter continual attacks, one short one and he's back at it,... or blocked SteveBaker for vandalism at all as he continues to do now and do as much damage to me he can? No. Or punished those dealing out blocks to me when they knew I did nothing for political bias? Did Wikipedia give me credit for my work and ban the copyright infringer and ultimate dark and threatening talker Freitas and Merkle  from this place NO! 

Wikipedia's rules clearly allow the publishing of lies from longer standing people of note, no mater how nefariously they slam the up and coming and tell lies far and wide and Wikipedia knowingly lets them. This is a media rag, period. Like any other. There are no real rules when they apply differently to one than another. Further, again, if you are being destroyed by unfair rules you have a Boston Tea party. Get it? It's called """"self defense"""" something you clearly do not understand. The only rule is a fair one and I don't see you or any other here trying to keep them fair in any way form of fashion you are just blowing political smoke. If you did we would not be here. I have not once been treated fairly and I don't see you doing it or anyone here that bothers to hang around here. You speak of rules, then block those that wrongly attacked me first before I even had a chance to play fair. Before I stuck my head out of the womb as a newbie around here. Don't walk away when I am being punished wrongly and you know it and above all don't drag my good name through the mud like a pig would do Mr. media guy. If you treat me fairly, you would be the first, from Larry King to Don and Mike to the Chief of police in Prince William County Virginia who had me arrested five times knowing I was innocent saying I was crazy for just talking about a self-replicator, even with my patent in my hand, gold seal and all (and you won't write of that here, not fairly). You want fair rules start making and enforcing them fairly and changing the unfair ones here starting here and now (but you wont). But most of all punish those who start the transgressions, not those fighting to defend themselves from the initial onslaught. And do not tell me you do not have special preferences around here.

I have contacted every lawyer on the list at the patent office and they will not sue a university professor (to answer you that question). Do me a fair article and you will never hear from me again because I am only here to fight a bad bio attack on me, that is all.

Dear Wikinews, Wikipedia  since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such. 

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete """"when in doubt don't delete"""" and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.

Ever thought why there is so much pressure to add links to phobic sites made by illeterate liers that are driven by hate
Ever thought why there is so much pressure to add a picture of Muhammad riding Burraq to Muhammad page .
Ever thought why there is  so much pressure that Jihad means """"holy war""""( aka kill all infedils ) only . And not a """"cleanse oneself spiritually"""" kind of philosophy also . 

Well every question has an answer , as there is no effect without causality .

As you might have guessed , this is the tip of ice berg . A lot is going on , under cover . Being the followers of a cult , they dont show their intentions . This is why they use PM & not talk about it on forums now . These so called good faith editers are running a whole Project Wikipedia to attack each & every page associated with Islam . This has been happening under our noses for not less then 6 months , & now its officially made a project .

There was a thread there which has been deleted by Sina . So for the benifit of all sane thinking people , I have added these threads to WP , so that if some muslim hacks FFI , & by some coincidence only these threads are deleted ( as Sina says ) , then these will be present as an evidence on WP . 

Now , 

Do we want WP to become a mirror site of FFI . 
Do we want phobic psychos to run around all over WP . 
Do we want to explain the same things over & over again to people who always say that they are a newbie on WP , & want to make it better . After some time of copy pasting filth from their hate site, they vanish & some others show up with the same language , same mentality & same """"Stuff"""" . 

I was also thinking for some time what happened to all venom spitting Sina-philes , & why are we now having some decent looking  people wanting to add their links to WP . Well that is also in the Sinan recommenddations of """"How to attack WP"""" . U can all see Zeno's edits at Muhammad , & Jihad . The pressure to add a picture of Muhammad , pressure to add cresent as a symbol of Islam , Pressure to call Jihad bin nafs some mythical concept popularised by Sufis . Still in Jihad article , Zeno has changed """" Ibn taymia, scholar of classical Islam """" to """" Ibn taymia , The classical, militant scholar of Islam """" .  Dont you think he could have easily changed to """"Ibn taymia , the founder of Salfi thought in Islam .

Would any body who doesnt care waste so much time on adding links , He also brought two well known trolls from FFI to back him up . May be its the new strategy , work in clans , one carrot two sticks  , & a lot of anon IPs .

Even, and especially, if you claim that Hardy is their real last name and not a stage name, then there is an unbelievable coincidence then that they chose to be called the Hardy Boyz and not the Hardy Brothers,, the Hardies or whatever. This does not distract from their image, don't take it personally. Please explain why Hardy Boyz has no relation to anything else and was a pure creative idea. 

I'm sorry if I sound rude, but do you even watch wrestling? Do you have any clue what you are talking about? Hardy is their legal last name. Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. So they are called the Hardy Boyz. Jeez, you would think if you wanted to edit a wrestling article, you would at least know what you are talking about. Again, sorry if you take this offensively, but its the truth.  (talk)  

While you continue to ignore my argument, the argument you use is childish and preposterous and you really don't care if I watch wresting, which leagues or since when either. Whether Hardy is their real last name or not is not the issue. The facts are that 
a) whether you like it or not, Hardy Boyz is a stage name, not unlike the Hart Foundation, and the Beverly Brothers, 
b) the Hardy Boys existed way before the Hardy Boyz adopted this variation. 
Soon your going to tell me that the name 'Hulk' in Hulk Hogan, has nothing to do with the previous usage regarding the green giant? Nobody has claimed a copyright violation, and I have absolutely no clue, and frankly wikipedia does not care, why you think that you have master editing rights on this article.  
First, The Hart Foundation were called that because the real names of the characters are Bret HART and Jim NeidHART. """"Hardy"""" is their legal last name. Please do some research first, since they are sometimes called the Hardy's. Maybe they chose Hardy Boyz instead of Hardy Brothers because of the books, you would have to ask Matt or Jeff that.

If you would only listen to yourselves, you'd hear that their real name isn't 'Hardy Boyz' at all, and that they've chosen this stage name over """"Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy"""".

Not even those Muslim Gibraltarians who decided to remain Muslim were """"exterminated"""" (most simply quietly converted to christianity to avoid problems).

Go out in a blaze of glory...on my own talk page???  No, that's not my intention at all.  It's a very small venue to go out on, I can assure you.  My intention is simply to tell the truth.  Even if it hurts.  On that, I don't compromise.  If that appears suidical to you, it's a sad indictment on the frequency of truth telling in you neck of the woods.  Others compromise on truth, often because they care about $$$ more than truth.  That's what I believe motivates the deletions on WP and elsewhere regarding monetary reform.  That's why this stuff isn't EVER published in """"mainstream"""" sources.  This stuff is starved of funds until it dies.  People who care about $$$ more than truth hate people pointing this out to them.  Because it hurts.  It shows they aren't very smart, but they are very selfish.  It's as simple as that.

One other thing.  Wealth distribution is a separate and distinct issue from the issue of money creation and distribution.  They are related and they do interact, but they are distinct issues.  Many Libertarians (such as Ron Paul) couldn't care less about wealth distribution provided the way in which money creation is just and in accordance with the U.S. Constitution.  Free markets can determine wealth distribution - provided the way in which money is created is open and democractically approved and """"just"""" and the product of rational discussion (i.e. not based on the threat of a bullet to the head if you question the current method of money creation and distribution).  Once new money is created, it gets gets circulated according to the tax laws, and competition laws, and finance laws and a multitude of other factors, and ends up in someone's account somewhere.  Money creation is (arguably) much more important and has many more dynamic implications for an economy than wealth distribution, which is a separate issue.  Again, this confusion shows that the level of understanding of these issues is woeful and I despair at ever increasing the general public's understanding of these vitally important issues, especially given the limitless $$$s financing the countervailing forces (Gregalton, Zenwhat, etc) that are lined up against anyone questioning the sustainability and pointing out the absolute stupidity of the current debt-based system.

Hi.
I was just wondering why you removed my edit on the Mackem rivalry page?  What I added, I believe to be a fact.  Perhaps we could work on making it more neutral if you thought it may offend anyone?  I am originally from South Shields, which is more or less equidistant from the rival cities.  I am currently however, living in Middlesbrough.  The rivalry in South Shields is slightly more noticable since it is geographically and socially directly in the middle, and also because it has more of a mix of Necastle United and Sunderland AFC supporters.  The rivalry is especially evident in the new town of Washington as it seems (I might be wrong) to have approximately an equal amount of Geordie and Mackem residents.

I don't want to offend anyone, however, I believe my edit should be included in the article in some form, as it is true that there are a considerable amount of people in both Newcastle and Sunderland who don't have a clue about the origins of the rivalry.  They tend to attribute it entirely on football, or in extreme cases, for no reason at all.  Sometimes, whenever a Geordie or a Mackem makes a reference to the rivalry, I question them.  Most of the time, their response was just """"don't know why,"""" or """"because they are scum!"""" and cound not give a reasonable argument.

Let me know how you feel about this.

I agree fully.  There's nothing inherently pejorative about the term.  """"Redskin"""" and """"Pale Face"""" even enjoy a certain amount use as terms of affection between the two races.  I imagine that there are some Native Americans who dislike the term (just as some, maybe even more understandably, hate the word """"Indian""""), just as there are some who find the terms white, black, and yellow offensive.  (Though """"yellow"""" is probably a special case, since it is sometimes associated with cowardice, there are still some contexts in which few if any people would be offended by it, such as in """"all people, whether White, Black, Red, or Yellow, should be treated equally"""", in which the usage is very explicitly non-derogatory.)

Although, this may depend on the area or the individuals involved.  For example, a Native American would probably not be offended by being called a  """"Redskin"""" by a White friend who he knows to be anything but a racist, but might strongly object to being called a """"Redskin"""" by a member of the KKK.  Likewise, in areas where Native Americans are the largest racial """"minority"""", there has probably already been a long history of mutual cooperation and friendship between the Whites and """"Redskins"""" of the area (and many Whites who very proudly boast a Native herritage), who would not immediately think any word was intended pejoratively unless given good reason to do so.  I know in my area, where racism against Mexicans and Asians is somewhat common (and sadly, even expected), the idea of racism against Natives is strange and alien, since the Whites and the Redskins here have such a long history together and such a strong respect for one another.  Although that might also have to do with the fact that most of the cities in my area were founded by Scottish and Irish immigrants who were treated as outcasts in the rest of the U.S., so the Whites who settled here in the early years knew first-hand how hurtful prejudices and stereotypes could be.

In any event, it's not really accurate (and more than a little ignorant) to say that the word """"Redskin"""" is a pejorative, when it is clearly not an offensive word in all contexts, and may even be, as mentioned above, a term of as a term of affection.  00:01, August 16, 2005 (UTC)""","Asendoh, you suck.

It cover what is actually going on, and I am in my rightd to inform a person of what his actions have result in. You do not have the right to supress this warning unless you contact me and/or give an explaination for your reason to suppress it. You failed to do any iof it.
I idn't receive any messages from you not even after you had banish me, yhought your message above is dated of the 26 of august it wasn't there at that date and I am sure of it. I didn't have acces to anything that day.
About the things I edit, they are of the most relevant kind to what is sayed ont this site.
All pseudo subbjects are all lies as the Bogdanovs have alredy answered all those points in different places of the web, inclusiv wiki, at different times, for the past 2 years.
For 13 days ago there was absolutely nothing more to discuss about, and seeing that, YBM used his ususal tactic who is to do as if they din't have answered the questions at hand, and that way, confuse the other users and make them believe that it was the case, as he has always done since 2003.
Someone has to stand up and say it, someone has to put an end to this circus, and I choose to do so.
I do not have followed the story from the beginning and do not know the Bogdanov but through this affair, that I begin to interest myself with since the beginning og august.
Two things became clear for me as I scanned all the web on the subjects: YBM was the person doing all the staging, and YBM didn't knew what he was talking about. I also found out that no matter how many times and in how many languages and by how many specialists the answers were given to him, he will keep asking and accusing peoples, and agress them personnally and accuse them of not being edicated in that field or critisized their university or making threat at contacting their chiefs, and even insult them to push them away from the discussion platform, as this kind of people represented a real threat to his status.
And of course, especially when we are talking of the scientific platform like in fr. physic or scent physic, those people, phd or professor at university were not used at being roll around with nor being talking to that way and even less at being insulted and confronted with non argumentativ methods.
So they left and never show up again, leeving all free room that YBM could ever wish for to pursue his goal.
But what was this goal exactly?
It wasn't the truth as he kept lying and had been given all answers, and was often denying to have done certain things who were appearing very often.
He was repeating himself and soon I saw a pattern emerging, from all his apparitions on the web, with falsh accusations, lies, home made stories, fantasyfull evidences, links to web sites from his own making, agression, personal attacs, insults.
His goal was not at all to discuss science but to manipulate others and he managed to do so very well as he was allowed to fool so many for such a long time. T>wo years is a very long time for a little subject as this one.
Then I was contacted by people who had been confronted to him, prior to this case, and had been subject to the same attacks and methods on the web.
I stude it, and saw worse than I could ever imagined. It was all planed from the beginning and a part of an ideologie with filosofical pretenses on how one could manipulate other people meaning by creating a situation on line.
It is what they call Post situationism, and wich is issued of Voyer. In the previous case against a teacher that he knew from school and a women writer (on cooking books!) he had just met Voyer but been found of him for a longer time, by the beginning of Bogdanovs affair he had been introduce inside the rangs of Voyer and Co, and as the affair progressed assured himself a high status in this """"confrerie"""".
That is the reason why this article I come with is of such importance. It reveal what was behind all along, what motivated the principal actors of this mascarade, and show all that they have been manipulated from the beginning and still are.
There is no Bogdanov affair, it is an illusion, a part from a group of ideologs making a thinking experiment and giving life to it by means of the internet.
Brillant! Unless there was casualties.
And there is.
Plenty of, and more than the Bogdanovs private sphere and their career.
I was really aroused from the beginning when I realised what YBM was about but even more when I saw what it all was really about, I was shocked by how unpropper and unethical it all was, and what a big unjustice it was to all who were involved in it, and this also include people who have followed and defended the apparent vews of YBM not kn","Good Work

I reject this notion

The article claims """"The defeat was attributed to massive vote splitting with the Greens, which in many cases allowed the Liberals to sneak up the middle and win""""  This claim is nonsensical when compared to the fact that the Liberals won 57% of the popular vote province wide.  Even if the remaining 43% had all voted for one party, the Liberals would have likely won anyways.  I personally went through the article and added all the vote totals for the NDP and Green candidates. (exlcuding the richmond and delta ridings because there was no totals)   I could only find 7 cases where, had ALL the voters for the Greens AND ndp voted for the same party, they would have defeated the Liberals.   If this had been the case the Liberals STILL would have had 65 of 72 (the legilature minus richmond and delta) seats versus only 9 for the NDP.  The NDP would still have lost 76.92% of their total seats in the legislature.  

So as a consequence I'm removing that sentence.

 Wikinews Australia Day 

I notice you haven't been at Wikinews for a couple of weeks.  However there is an article stuck at the starting blocks for a couple of days that might benefit from another Australian taking a look, so I hope you don't mind my posting here at Wikipedia:

 Australia celebrates Australia Day 2009

(It reports on the cricket in Adelaide, if that interests you.)

  

It is now published.  Good luck for the ODI in Perth!   
Yeah, I pinged someone on IRC to review it, because I wasn't sure of the current standards. Regards,   

 Archived clarification 

 Perhaps I am missing something and you have been requested to archive this; however, as we are still in the middle of voting on motions here, could you please reinstate this?  Thanks.    
Once a motion reaches the majority (or in this case, the majority plus a couple), and has been that way for 24 hours, it is considered passed. Is there any special circumstance which allows you to request the passing of this motion to be delayed?   
The motions passed at 01:51 on today's date, which is less than 24 hours. As well, additional clarifications were made in the last 24 hours. I wouldn't call them """"special"""" circumstances, I expect them to remain on the page for at least the 24 hours after the motion passes so that the involved parties can read them.    
Oh, so you'd like me to restore them for three hours then, despite the fact that they are going to read them when I deliver the talk page notifications anyways? Go right ahead. Done. Please also note that in future, given this little piece of silliness by the Committee, everything is going to be archived right on time, and if any member of the Committee objects they need to show me a majority of the Committee supporting their viewpoint before they can do anything about it. It's this kind of ridiculousness—I'm going out in two hours and hence, given the votes over and beyond the majority, it has never been a problem to archive something 3 hours early with such strong support for the motions—that pisses me off about the Committee. We follow the Arbitration Committee procedures, and hence your observation that we need to be """"requested to archive this"""" in your initial comment is a patently incorrect line of thinking.
Ridiculous...   
To be more precise, the first motion passed with Newyorkbrad's abstention at 02:22 UTC, and there were two clarifying comments made to that motion following his vote, in part to address his concerns. You're certainly encouraged to have a life outside of Wikipedia; it's one of the reasons why we have a group of clerks instead of just one. If it's not convenient for you to take an action, I am sure that another member of the team will be happy to do so.    

Hi Daniel, sorry to toss another piece of bureaucracy at you, but since technically this was a clarification of the Martinphi-ScienceApologist case, shouldn't it be posted on that case's talkpage? onka 
No, because it served to amend the SlimVirgin case. I will post a link at the talk page of the Martinphi-ScienceApologist case to where the motions are archived, but given the Martinphi-SA case wasn't the one being clarified or altered, it's correct residence is the SlimVirgin talk page.   
 Okay, thanks.  )  I wanted to link to the archive, so I wanted to doublecheck that I was linking to the permanent home.  Carry on, onka

OK...you all call my behavior 'aggressive,' but I consider it WP:BOLD. You all call my editing behavior 'uncivil,' but I just call it 'being vocal' about the removal of valid material from Wikipedia. I will refrain from using 'strong language' in edit summaries in the future, including capital letters. You say that: """"This is persistent and entrenched behavior on your part that you don't seem to understand or want to change after many warnings and two blocks""""  I've never had any substantial warnings, only the two expedited blocks. You say that I should """"accept the rules"""" when other editors are totally disregarding and/or misquoting them, or trying to pass off essays and guidelines as policy when they are not. The fact is that if someone is removing good/valid/sourced material from Wikipedia, I'm going to call them out on it. Any way that you put it, strong wording in edit summaries is not a valid reason to perma-block people, as short sentences like that can easily be taken out of context.

Regarding my claims of censorship and vandalism in the above-mentioned edit summaries: I'm not sure what else to call it if not censorship and vandalism...I suppose I could always call it """"the constant removal of valid categories/information from articles,"""" but that would be whitewashing the issue. For whatever reason, entirely valid, relevant, and sourced material is consistently removed from many articles (Paul Wolfowitz, Ben Bernanke, Lewis Libby, others) by the same editors again and again, and after a while it just gets very old, ridiculous, and frustrating to have to keep inserting this valid information over and over. By the way: I consider the removal of valid material/categories from articles over and over again to be censorship and vandalism...don't you? Some kind-of phantom clause in WP:BLP is constantly cited to try to justify the removal of this information even though this information is currently found in thousands of other articles with no problem at all.

When I wrote """"Revery [sic] Jayjg's idiotic edit..."""" in an edit summary for removing Category:Ethnic nationalism from the White nationalism article I only made that statement because the very first sentence of the article said """"White nationalism (WN) is a form of ethnic nationalism...""""  thus the removal of said category seemed rather idiotic in my opinion since the first sentence of the article obviously confirmed that particular category. Jayjg then changed that first sentence (he provided no source for this edit) and removed the category. I never called Jayjg idiotic, only that particular edit.

Since everything I write on here seems to be misconstrued, taken the wrong way, and wrongfully considered 'uncivil' and/or 'aggressive' (what is and what is not 'civil' and 'aggressive' is highly POV and a matter of opinion, by the way), I plan to edit  and remove any and all information that could be considered 'offensive' or 'uncivil'  I am going to bring the page down to the basics.

Truthfully, I try my best to avoid getting caught up in all of these Wiki-politics, personal vendettas, petty edit wars, childish games, etc.; I am part of no group/cabal here, I stick to myself and mind my own business, and improve and expand Wikipedia as best I can. However, when I see factual edits constantly being reverted for no apparent reason (what I term censorship and vandalism) it tends to make me a bit angry, so I have no choice except to be vocal about it and hope that other good editors see what is happening and will begin to take action and discuss these issues. That's another thing...the complete and utter lack of discussion by these people, whether in edit summaries or on talk pages. I would like to discuss these issues (and I always try to leave a good edit summary), but whenever I try to discuss these issues the response I so often get is one or two bogus sentences and the mindless repetition of a bunch of Wikipedia essays/guidelines (NOTE: NOT POLICIES) in an attempt to justify the censorious deletion/vandalism """"the constant removal of valid categories/information from articles.""""

Oh Mark, for shame! Why lie? I didn't get banned from the Clitoris article for any such thing. I didn't get banned from it at all. I was banned from removing the picture that upset several editors. You pretended you had a """"unanimous"""" """"consensus"""" then too. I didn't constantly run any polls. That's a downright lie too. Why would I? I don't think polls demonstrate consensus and I oppose their use to settle content disputes. I've expressed that view many, many times. The dispute on clitoris in fact centred around a group of editors who were bullying minority-view editors because they had won a vote. They largely refused to discuss the salient issues because, they believed, they had won a vote and that was that. (Careful Tony Sidaway watchers will note that on Talk:Clitoris he was insistent that winning a vote was the same as having a consensus but on Talk:something about B roads, he had changed his tune and thought that votes were evil. Like most of the people who voted here, it's one rule when it fits your POV, another when it doesn't.) This title is shockingly POV. That you can line up a bunch of editors who share the POV that it pushes to vote and say no it's not doesn't actually not make it so, but I've given up trying to get editors to accept that the proZionist stance that is so common in your home country is not actually """"neutral"""".

Penis envy
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search

Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.

In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.

[edit] Freud's Theory

Sigmund Freud introduced the concept of a little girl's interest in—and envy of— the penis in his 1908 article """"On the Sexual Theories of Children,"""" but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work On Narcissism was published. It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905).

The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see Psychosexual development).

In Freud’s psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events—known as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.

For girls:

    * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.
    * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.
    * She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.
    * She develops a sexual desire for her father.
    * The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.
    * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.
    * The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.
    * The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)
    * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.

The offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.

A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.

Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen",Give me a permanat block raseac....!!! remember me....!!!

A simple review of the templates would have shown that any alleged accessibility problems would need to be dealt with by a change in the behaviour of class=""""abbr"""" in MediaWiki, and are therefore not a topic for discussion here. That the nominator did not conduct the most simple research before nominating these templates for deletion is shown here: the fact that the TfD notice was not included within  tags led to the disruption of over 5000 articles, something which the nominator could have prevented had he thought to used simple discussion before even contemplating bringing the matter here. The disruption was completely predictable, given that the nominator chose to nominate more than 200 templates at once. The speedy keep does not imply any judgment on the accessibility questions raised in the discussion, which should be addressed in more appropriate fora.  (talk) 
I have no objection to this being closed as keep, as there was consensus in that direction; but that was a provocative and insulting closure notice.
Firstly, it seems you're yet another person who has never actually bothered to read Wikipedia:Speedy keep, as your reasons for speedy keeping are at odds with what is written there. Secondly, it is not at all clear why TFD is not the place to discuss a vast collection of templates whose only purpose is a gimmick that breaks web accessibility. Thirdly, the whole point of the  template is for it to be transcluded with the template, in order to advertise the discussion. If I had noincluded it, I might well have been accused of trying to hide the discussion. Therefore your suggestion that I """"did not conduct the most simple research"""" is a great steaming load of crap.
It is pretty obvious from the hostile tone of your response, together with the fact that you're deeply involved in chemistry articles, that you didn't like the nomination, and decided to speedy close the discussion instead of just saying your piece and waiting for an unbiased closure.

TheShadowCrow's argument for the WBC not using caps was that it's not an English speaking org, when his example, the diabolical WBA, isn't either. What an absolute idiot.

TheShadowTard comes along making a complete mess of these records and pages, then after I revert his clumsy edits, he comes sniveling to the admins' talk pages claiming it's ME who's attacking the pages. What a complete and utter lying hypocritical spastic. He knows nothing about boxing.

This entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you'd think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation

""""According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: """"Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery."""" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.""""

This author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it's a fact?

There are articles for """"Criticisms of Islam"""" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate """"criticisms of Islam"""" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.

Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn't serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted.

This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins. He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.

So how many people with the attitude that """"reality is a commodity"""" does it take before it's reality?  I have peer reviewed the idea that """"reality is a commodity"""" and I agree.  In fact, I've decided to pick it up!  

I love this stuff. Fred pays Jim to lob a brick thorough a shopkeeper's window. Who gets the blame? the shopkeeper!  

  I see what you did there. But there's more backstory to that shopkeeper than meets the eye. So there's this shopkeeper, right? And this shopkeeper, he has a shop that doesn't exactly sell anything. He just stands in his shop all day, and gives people answers to whatever they want to know. Now people start noticing this shopkeeper, and they feed the shopkeeper information to answer these questions as well as asking them things they need to know. It becomes a tightly knitted community. Things go well, until people start to unquestioningly believe what the shopkeeper has to offer. These people here, they forget that people like them are the ones feeding him information, and that whoever fed the shopkeeper this information might be just as clueless as they are. But they keep asking, and the shopkeeper keeps telling.

  Then Fred here comes along, and notices this from an outside perspective. He notices the fundamental flaw in that the advice people are getting from the shopkeeper is just as flawed as the people who told the shopkeeper the information in the first place. So Fred goes up to these people and points this out to them, but nobody seems to care. They're all happy as can be, asking their shopkeeper whatever they need to know and blindly believing what he has to offer. Some of them even retaliate against Fred for disrupting their bubble of ignorance. 

  Fred knows there's nothing that he, Fred, can do to stop this situation. But Fred here, he knows that if something isn't done, people will continue to flock to the shopkeeper like cancer patients to the messiah. And Fred knows guys. And these guys, well, they just happen to own a few bricks. So Fred calls up Jim, slips him some money, and Jim lobs a brick through the shopkeepers window. Of course in this instance, the shopkeeper is Wikipedia. The shopkeeper's devout followers are people who use the Wiki religiously. Fred is Steven Colbert, Jim is anyone willing to follow Steven, and bricks are the messages of those willing people who think that that anyone who uses the wiki religiously, and is willing to attack somebody for calling them on it, should take a step back and look at things in perspective. 
So the shopkeeper had it coming.  

a Steven Colbert is funy  and he is only useing he's First Amendment right to Freedom of speech

Stone Censors
I don’t know that I’m wrong; in fact, I’m quite certain that you and AuburnPilot are in the wrong. You can censor me and block me all you want – you’ve got the power – but you can’t make me confess to wrongs of which I am innocent. Not yet, anyway. And you can’t make me say that you’re right, when you are as wrong as hell. It’s about time somebody talked back to you.

“If you were to discuss your edits, you won't [sic] be in this position right now.” (Since I had already discussed my edits, physicq’s statement above is a case of “a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood.”)

That’s funny peculiar, because wikicensors with the correct politics somehow never have to “discuss” their “edits.” They just go and censor people with whom they disagree, and then demand that the censees justify the worth of the censored passages or links or footnotes. And guess what? The censees’ explanations, no matter how well-founded and eloquent, are never sufficient to make the censors change their minds. Once an editor realizes that nothing he says will have any positive effect on the censors (or should I say, """"commissars""""?), he would be a fool to waste his time and energy trying to change that which cannot be changed. That the censors continue demanding such arguments is because they have a sadistic glee for wasting other people’s precious time and energy.

In case an open-minded (but perhaps less experienced) reader should suspect that I am just engaging in bluster, I had already made my argument in my previous entry on this page (which AuburnPilot has archived in a handsome tan box at the bottom of User_talk:AuburnPilot under the uncivil category, “spam”) for why the footnotes and links I inserted were legitimate, but physicq aka physicq210 derided those arguments as a “polemic, complete with fallacious personal attacks,” and mocked my criticism of his abuse of authority as “whining.” In one case, I pointed out that the external link that AuburnPilot defamed as “spam” and censored, was a classic magazine article related to the  Racial Profiling Hoax.

(Speaking of which, Wikipedia's Racial profiling article is hopelessly POV through the censors’ deleting of links to articles debunking the hoax, and inserting of links to fraudulent “literature” such as thoroughly debunked work by the ACLU.)

In the case of a footnote that AuburnPilot also defamed as “spam” and censored, he cut the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the  Duke Rape Hoax, which was published by the most brilliant, reliable magazine on the Web, VDARE.

BTW, AuburnPilot asserts that the sources in question are not “reliable” or “verifiable,” and do not maintain “neutrality.” Aside from the fact that thousands of Wikipedia articles are transparent political propaganda, or no more than love or hate letters to certain public figures (particularly entertainers or athletes), AuburnPilot has misrepresented the Wikipedia rule on neutrality. There is no requirement that every source be neutral (as opposed to reliable and verifiable), only that every Wikipedia article be neutral.

WP:NPOV

“All Wikipedia articles must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by a reliable source. For guidance on how to make an article conform to the neutral point of view, see the NPOV tutorial.”

As for “verifiablilty,” the VDARE source has over 100 hyperlinks to supporting documentation from newspapers, magazines, TV and radio news organizations, and legal filings; if that isn’t “verifiable,” then nothing is.

Now, I ask you. If I have already made my best argument for including the aforementioned links and footnotes, and physicq aka physicq210 responds by misrepresenting what I said, claiming that I have made no attempt at supporting my position, and referring to my defense as “whining,” what possible reason could I have for continuing such a charade?

Plus, why should I be on the defensive? If I were dealing with fair, reasonable people, that might make sense. But fair, reasonable people would not do as AuburnPilot did, and first censor my edits, and then demand I justify their value on the talk pages. (And physicq would not have responded to an edit war by throwing in with AuburnPilot, immediately blocking me, and charging me with “disruptive edits.” That alone is proof of physicq’s unfitness as an administrator.) No, AuburnPilot would not have censored my work, but would have asked me on the talk page why I thought it belonged. No, strike that. He would have hit the links and read the articles in question.

THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

With this in mind, most people dealing with this issue, attempt to mitigate the problem by understanding that all knowledge is `situated' knowledge, and that all judgements come from a particular standpoint. This means that it is understood that no one can claim to be 100% ‘neutral’ or ‘objective’, and that there are always power struggles involved when someone claims to be `objective` (especially whilst engaging in partisan behaviour).

A conservative estimate of the number of adults and children suffering from ME suggests that there are around 250,000 in the UK, yet it is rarely diagnosed by the medical profession, is fleetingly mentioned in government research funding documents, is seldom accepted by medical research workers, and is almost never admitted to by insurance companies. 

TABSince 1986, while gathering around him an entourage of like minded disciples which has become known as the Wessely School, Professor Simon Wessely, has almost single-handedly been responsible for the strategy of a moratorium on the investigation of ME as an illness  with a physically neurological cause. Professor Wessely is a psychiatrist, and for nearly twenty years he has promulgated the idea that ME and the broader groupings of chronic fatigue illnesses (CFS) are the product of ‘false illness beliefs’, mental aberrations, which can be diagnosed and treated with psychiatric based therapies and anti-depressants. 

TABProfessor Wessely carries out research mainly in the London-based Institute of Psychiatry which is situated in King’s College teaching hospital. He is a member of numerous research organisations and advisory groups, and is advisor to the British Armed Services. While his membership of an ‘official’ web of research organisations tell us a lot about his work, added substance to his views is to be found in his more informal and less renowned associations with a number of minority-view groups set up by, or aligned with US and British ‘quackbuster’ organisations. 

TABJust before Christmas 2005, the Wikipedia, an electronic and sometimes publicly edited encyclopaedia, was host to a small, anonymous entry about Professor Wessely. The entry appeared to have originated with someone opposed to Wessely’s psychiatric view of ME. On seeing this entry, Jane Bryant of the One Click (OC) campaign substituted a longer text, which contained not just biographical facts but a broader description of Wessely’s role in the politics of ME. 

TABWhen this longer text was seen by the Wikipedia ‘edit police’ who cruise the pages seeking ‘vandalism’ and 'skewed' edits, it was immediately considered to break most of Wikipedia’s self serving rules. On writing to the owner and founder of Wikipedia, ‘Jimbo’ Wales, in an attempt to put their case, the OC campaign received a personal communication from him. 

Although Wales, aimed at a slight up-beat and reconciliatory tone in his e-mail, the text was scattered with veiled insults. He accused One Click participants of ‘behavioural problems’, while stating that OC organisers had lied and purposefully made libellous statements in their posted piece on Wessely. He made clear even at this early stage of the exchange that Wikipedia would from then on act on the basis that ‘anything from your site (will be treated) with extreme scepticism.’ Jimbo Wales, ended his e-mail with an exhortation for everyone to settle differences and unit in the spirit of Wikichristmas. 

TABWhen, however, OC answered Jimbo with a rebuttal of his argument in favour of an orthodox objectivity and neutrality – ‘we are not going to be advocates for or against either side in this dispute’ - the debate entered another level.

TABIt seems possible that Professor Wessely, having been alerted to his Wikipedia entry began to liaise with Wikipedia and the business of drafting a  Soviet-style biographical text about him was given to the indulgently named Just Zis  Guy, you know?

He accused One Click participants of ‘behavioural problems’, while stating that OC organisers had lied and purposefully made libellous statements in their posted piece on Wessely. He made clear even at this early stage of the exchange that Wikipedia would from then on act on the basis that ‘anything from your site (will be treated) with extreme scepticism.’ Jimbo Wales, ended his e-mail with an exhortation for everyone to settle differences and unit in the spirit of Wikichristmas. 

TABWhen, however, OC answered Jimbo with a rebuttal of his argument in favour of an orthodox objectivity and neutrality – ‘we are not going to be advocates for or against either side in this dispute’ - the debate entered another level.

TABIt seems possible that Professor Wessely, having been alerted to his Wikipedia entry began to liaise with Wikipedia and the business of drafting a  Soviet-style biographical text about him was given to the indulgently named Just Zis  Guy, you know?

The followers of Claude Vorilhon call him """"His Holiness""""; what do you think of that? If they called him """"Holy Father"""", would that be legitimate? The pretension of a title does not mean that you ACTUALLY possess that title.

The following is a COMPLAINT AGAINST  for harassing user's about the Police State page

It seems that many users have had problems with  harassment and vandalism

, why do you continually harass other users and then falsly accuse them of """"vandalism"""" or other wiki-infringements? Please, do not delete this comment, I am only here as a mediator and this is NOT a personal attack. Only a simple question as to what motivates you to defame other users.

Here are the examples that I have compiled since being introduced to this issue. We have  who complains about your harassment on this talk page above. “I have not attacked you. Actually, quite the reverse. I have not exercized censorship. Quite the reverse. What's it called when you accuse others of being something that you actually are?”

 describes your actions as “rootless accusations of """"vandalism"""" in response to my recent edit of the wikipedia article """"police state"""" don't even pass the straight face test.”

 even took the time to write a letter to the administrators about your behavior.

Dear Administrators:""""I would like to file a complaint against user """"nescio"""" for wanton vandalism of the article entitled """"Police State"""". User Nescio has been deleting sections of the article he or she personally disagrees with e.g. historical police state examples """" Chile under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet"""" and """"Argentina under the Proceso de Reorganización Nacional"""", as well as other examples . This childish and irrational behaviour has resulted in a blatant misrepresentation of the facts, which is detrimental to Wikipedia's credibility and accuracy. I have tried to reason with this user, but it is unfortunately to no avail.Regretfully , I have no choice but to request that this user be blocked from editing at this time. Sincerely yours,User Winston Smith describes you as “the worst editor I have EVER encountered on wikipedia” while encouraging you to “Please stop this childish behavior.”

 had his warnings to you about harassment deleted and reported you as a vandal * has repeatedly reverted to prior revisions of the police state article after being instructed to view the discussion page. I then placed a warning on  talk page, which he promptly removed. He continues to remove the warnings.  has requested sources for the addition, at least five have been provided, yet  refuses to acknowledge their existence and insists on trying to incite an edit war.      is continuing to remove edits and warnings of mine from his talk page  while falsely accusing me of stalking  and sock puppetry.      I have to say that Nescio and others had understandable grounds on which to suspect you of sockpuppetry. Fact is, you appeared on scene the day of/shortly after three genuine sockpuppets appeared, and you shared the same POV and short history of editing.  

Please explain what makes you think that  is a sockpuppet? Can you cite these actions of VinnyCee that are considered to be those of a sock-puppet?  

 I just did. It turns out that Vinny Cee is not a sockpuppet (at least, of anything we checked), but there was good reason to suspect she was.  

So VinnyCee is not'' a sock puppet. This means that Nescio's accusation of him being a sock puppet is false. Did you """"check"""" into whether the other accusations made by Nescio against other users are also false? I would bet that they are.

 More useful info 
A voice chat session was conducted soon after the episode 7 release, during which the pure pwnage crew answered questions from fans around the globe. There was quite a bit of interesting info to gain from listening to recordings of the chat session. Some of this info should probably be worked into the article here. One such recording is currently at http://chigau.com/ppchat-edited.mp3 Another artifact related to the show would be Anastasia's blog. However, I cannot ascertain the true nature of this blog (whether it's Anastasia's 'real' blog, or just a prop set up for the show). Despite the fact that it is claimed to be the real blog, during the chat session mentioned above, I find it hard to believe the claim, due to the language used throughout the blog itself.

 You can bet your life it's not real ;-) 
 The fact that the blog mentions Jeremy being put in the hospital for playing WoW is an obvious give away that the blog is purely fictional.  02:07, August 20, 2005 (UTC)
 Don't be so sure. That's how I felt until I started looking around a bit more. Listen to the chat, read the blog, browse some of their forums. Now I'm not so sure. Considering that the blog starts before the sixth episode it seems pretty real and the way they keep mentioning on the forums that when they have PP meets people can't belive how close to the truth the show is. 
 It's fiction, partly based on real life. Come on, if you think PP is really happening watch the 9th episode.
-someonelse: well actually, i agree with aupajo. I'm not saying that people can shoot micro, or that  dave used to be some kind of micro warrior, but its possible that the crew used to act like they do in the first couple episodes, and changed their ways.

 Reviews of Pure Pwnage 

 by Anonymous (67.140.145.26) Essentially Jeremy embodies the very scum of online gaming in a package that is all too familiar.  Pathetic vocabulary skills, general lack of anything resembling cultural knowledge, and the lifestyle of the perpetual slacker round out the package nicely.  This is, unfortunately, what most people think of when you say 'gamer' unless you're talking about the pen and paper variety, which has it's own features (among them, the thankful lacking of the word """"n00b"""") that set it apart.  All in all I think this is a good parody of the gamer lifestyle, but unfortunately the misguided masses of preteens will attempt to emulate it further than they do on their own.  Online gaming is bad enough these days without stirring up that particular cesspool any more than needed.  In the end, it makes me yearn for the days of my youth when Quake's seperate online client was released.  Those were days when people would actually have intelligent conversation until the server filled up enough for a good game of CTF. (and that was before there even WAS a flag... it was a key)  Now, it's all n00b fagz0rz l0ll0rz!!!11!!!1one and corpse humping until you get bored and leave.  I can only hope that this scathing satire of that type of behavior will help show new gamers how NOT to act.

""","""The problem with saying that Warren G. Harding was the first African-American President is that it is a theory that is unproven by fact.  While many people believe this concept - some even go to great lengths to self publish books on the topics, there is no way to scientifically prove the concept, nor is there any way to verify generally accepted documents that could show this is even a possibility.  The rumor that Harding was black rages about based on two quotes, one by Harding himself (where he says he doesn't know if it could be true, the other a rumor started by his future father-in-law meant to destroy Harding's business and reputation.) Consider verifiable these FACTS on the matter:
1) Harding's alleged """"black"""" lineage can not be proven through United States Census forms, death certificate, or any other PRIMARY SOURCE document.  As far back as the 1850 census (the first to name all people enumerated, and designate their race) Harding's father and mother are enumerated as white.  This is most frequently dismissed by Harding Conspiracy followers who claim the census forms were doctored after the fact as part of a Federal Government cover-up.

2) There is no DNA proof of Harding's alleged """"black blood"""", (nor is there proof that Harding fathered Elizabeth Ann Christian).

3) Harding was not raised as a cultural """"black"""" that is to say that he was not raised within the black community, and therefore would have not had the same cultural experiences that other blacks in the era would have had.

4) """"Black Harding"""" promoters will point to William Estabrook Chancellor's book on Harding as proof of government conspiracy.  And it is interesting how swifty the government worked to squash the book and get its copies.  But if one looks at Chancellor's research methodology (and we step away from those who claim that the book was supressed) - all of it based on hearsay - any student in college today who would present this type of research in the form of a paper, masters thesis or dissertation would have been thrown out of college for faulty research!   

5) Some of the promoters of this theory of Harding's """"blackness"""" on """"family stories"""".  While folklore is not always untrue, folklore can be embellished from storyteller to storyteller. Ask anyone who studies it, folklore is at the mercy of the one who passes it on.

6) The promoters of these theories go to great lengths to attack the people who poke logical holes in their wishful arguments. They can not refute the facts, so they attack the people who question their beliefs. Take a look at the """"reviews"""" of Harding books published in the past ten years in places like Amazon and B&N; online and you'll get an idea how some people will attack those who do not buy into the black """"Black Harding"""" myth.

If Wikipedia were to add information that Harding was the first black President, without irrfetable proof, it simply ads another chain in the long list of unrliable misinformation.

Wow!  I just saw tonight's news article on Wikipedia that played on FOX News.  (Earlier, I'd posted here the AP article on Wikipedia from Dec 12, 2005.)

In what has become a huge coincidence, the very day the media begins reporting on the dangers of Wikipedia, happens to be the day immediately after the very week I discovered misinformation and falsehoods being posted on this page about nitrites, and then tried to edit them by attempting to add more accurate information, but then was attacked and harassed by another person who disagrees with my edits  and was ultimately blocked and threatened by a purported Wikipedia administrator.

As was reported in the news today, people can go to http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/ to learn more about how Wikipedia functions, and where the dangers exist.

The folks at wikipediawatch report that, what's happening in Wikipedia, is that any collection of citations that may APPEAR balanced is all that anybody expects. If the title or snippet in a link itself contributes to this impression, then the full text is not researched by anyone.

This is exactly what has been going on in this nitrite page.  As a result, it truly is, as wikipediawatch reminds us, """"garbage in, garbage out, garbage back in...""""  and after a few cycles of this, it all turns into """" a big, stinking heap"""".

Truly, as the news media warned today: """"Don't believe eveyrthing you read on the Web, especially on Wikipedia!""""

The following two posts, found in a wikipediareview blog, sum up my experiences this past week, after having been harassed, threatened and finally blocked, after I attempted to add to the body of knowledge about nitrites/poppers.  They demonstrate how dangerous Wikipedia  based on its current model  really is:

""""Wikipedia's procedural faults, complete anarchy as regards contributions, and sometimes-bizzare social rules do not teach people to become good researchers or writers... it teaches them how to be good Wikipedians, or to get the hell out."""" - Jason Scott
"""". . . when it comes to history and politics, Wikipedia can claim whatever it wants by shutting out those who actually know something about a certain topic. In that way, Wikipedia can rewrite history as it sees fit - which may have nothing to do with reality or the actual facts."""" - SummerFR

Finally, this post on a board, discussing wikipedia, really sets it out well:

""""Any moron can pretty well say anything they want on any topic, which is fine for a News Group or a Forum but not an Encyclopedia.

In my opinion a reference source should be authoritative enough to end arguments not start them.

I believe that Wikipedia could better serve the internet community if they checked their facts first before publishing the article.

Instead, we have a situation where the cart is placed before the horse and we end up with what is left by the horse.""""

You know, I've just been having this discussion on my talk page.  interesting.  What we currently have on project is a kind of pre-tribal band system, which can look like any other system (because the elements of all sophisticated political systems are present 'in the bud' in social bands). There are some elements of tribal society developing (Arbcom and administrators fill a role 'tribal elders' in loose tribal aggregates, policy and guidelines take on an almost mystical/devotional role in some discussions), but on individual pages it still largely devolves to conflicts between small ideologically insular groups fighting for control of a resource.  Aristocracy in any sense of the term would be a superior system; in Aristotle's sense it would be far superior.  

I'll admit that I'm a huge fan of consensus systems (I live for deliberative democracy…), but consensus systems are hard: they take a lot of self-reflection, a lot of self-moderation, and both a willingness and an ability to set aside small personal concerns in favor of large public concerns.  These features are noticeably absent from many of the more contentious discussions on project.  If we are not willing to take the steps to achieve a properly functioning consensus system, then we would really do better to try for another less-open approach, because dysfunctional consensus systems are ugly, ugly, ugly beasts.

You're both right in the sense that enough is enough. If you haven't noticed, I've hardly contributed a thing to the RefDesk in quite a while. If you also haven't noticed, many other valuable editors who used to contribute regularly just, say, a year ago, are now long gone. I suppose I was left the only one to hold the fort. It's now clear, however, that you simply don't appreciate what's happening here, and no matter how hard I try, you never will.

I know this will be futile, but I'll explain how I see things one last time: The Humanities RefDesk used to be a wonderful place to learn. OPs would ask questions, and a decent variety of intellectuals would put in their admittedly POV two-cents, with the result of providing the OP with a variety of differing POV answers, which is basically the closest one can get to an NPOV answer to any """"humanities"""" related topic. This was the Humanities RefDesk I fell in love with.

Now, however, it's pretty much dominated by one supposed omniscient Cambridge Phd. One who verbally abuses other editors in the cruelest and most sadistic of manners due to the """"folly"""" she percieves in their contributions (while the admins conveniently turn a blind eye). One who is incapable of those all-too-human facets known as humilty and fallability. This editor proceeds upon handing down, as if from above, her more-often-than-not flawed, revisionist, biased, and downright incorrect responses (and from my own ethnic POV, extremely offensive and insulting to the memory of my family) to historical questions. When these responses are succesfully challenged, she is incapable of responding in a civil manner (not just to me) and lowering herself to """"stand corrected"""".

These, to me, are not the makings of a RefDesk editor, nor a proper historian. 

But once again, you're right. Enough is enough. I've spent far too much time and effort on this. If you'd indeed prefer the Humanities RefDesk to degenerate into a ClioBlog, then that last obstacle you've been facing, little old Loomis51, has given up. I fought the good fight, and I'm damned proud of it. This, to me, is truly a sad day for Wikipedia.

This is no grand exit, no demand to be blocked, nothing melodramatic like that. I still love Wikipedia and its articles. Unfortunately that once great Humanities RefDesk that I couldn't wait to come to visit upon returning home from work, in order to learn new things, and (hopefully) return the favour by sharing whatever I know with others, is no longer. 

I'm not really sure what all those nonsensical """"conditions"""" you noted above were, nor did I pay much attention to them. Whether my words above are some sort of """"breach"""" of those conditions, I have no idea, nor do I care. 

I just can't help but find it funny that you've extended your jurisdiction to Wikiversity. What's next? If you can somehow hack into my Yahoo account, will my emails now be scrutinized for any anti-Clio content? How about MSN? Is it ok if I call Stu up on the phone and speak """"inappropriately"""" of her? lol (Not that either of us really cares about all this bullshit to actually talk on the phone about it, we have lives, you know! We've never even spoken on the phone, and interestingly, I know rather little about him except that he's apparently from Detroit and that we disagree on pretty much every issue except for the fact that Clio's a fraud! I'm actually rather curious. I've often wondered if Stu is perhaps some obese Asian guy, some skinny Black guy, some white senior citizen, or whatever!) 

If you want to block me, then block me. If you don't, then don't. It's all so obviously arbitrary that I really don't give a shit at this point what you do. All you should know is that I'm just pretty much fed up with the whole RefDesk farce, and I don't really see myself engaging in it in any way any time soon. I have absolutely no intention of any further """"Doctor Anastasia"""" bashing, as like I said, it's futile. If you don't believe me, then block me. If not, then don't. Do as you please.

Let me just mark this day, June 4th, 2007. Let's just see how the Humanities RefDesk looks in say, six months from now: December 4th, 2007. Will all be as is? Will any of my remarks ring any truer? Let's just see. In the meantime, adios muchachos!

You really don't seem to have got the hang of WP:NPOV/FAQ policy, and are advised to follow it carefully. Oh, and blanking your talk page is your right but it isn't impressive. . , talk 

I blanked the page because there was a lot of unnecessary old stuff on it.  

I know the NPOV extremely well and I'm always fighting against the EXTREME POV of Evolutionists.  The stuff I changed on Flood Geology is an example of extreme evolutionary POV.  I changed it to reflect reality.  Problem is, most Eovlutionists are completely unable to see their own POV.  And most of the editors of Flood Geology are not geologists.  I am an undergrad paleontologist.

Stop edit warring please
Stop edit warring on Flood geology to insert fringe claims, or you will be blocked. Please read WP:3RR, too.  | talk .

This topic is about a fringe belief so it ought to accurately reflect what flood geologists actually say.  But it is nonsense and full of misinformation and outright lies.  Not one of the editors defending the Evolutionary faith are geologists.  They just keep repeating the same nonsense debunked by creationists ages ago.     
The topic is about a fringe belief, so it ought to be written from a fringe point of view..? No, that's a mistake. For the amount of attention, and kind of attention, that is appropriate to what creationists have or have not """"debunked"""", see WP:UNDUE. Try to take Wikipedia policies on board, or you will find yourself blocked.  | talk .
I didn't say """"written from a fringe POV"""" I said it should reflect what flood geologists actually say, not what enemies says they say.  There is a big difference.  If critics wish to comment on what flood geologists actually say, fine.  But at least the actual position of flood geologists should be accurately presented.  As written, the page is deeply flawed and pushes a single POV.  The problem is that most evolutionists are totally ignorant of and blind to their POV pushing.  They actually think that they have no bias!! I am very familiar with WP policies, which I why I'm trying to get fair hearing instead of the deeply biased presentations currently on WP.     
You're misrepresenting your edits.The reason I warn you against edit warring is that you have recently reverted three times, within a short period of time, to insert one and the same change to the article: from """"This was interpreted as being the result of massive flooding, though it is now known that they are the product of ice age glaciations (an unknown phenomenon at that time)"""" to """"This was interpreted as being the result of massive flooding, though it is now interpreted as the product of ice age glaciations (an unknown phenomenon at that time)."""" And you say that change is about """"the actual position of flood geologists""""? No it isn't. You're changing, over and over, the description of the position of mainstream science. That's the exact opposite of what you claim to be doing. If you're """"very familiar with WP policies"""", I have to suppose you simply don't like them. I'm afraid I'm going to enforce them just the same: don't edit war any more, on this or any other article, or I will block you.  | talk .
And you honestly don't see the POV in """"known"""" versus """"interpreted""""?  Good grief.  You could say """"generally interpreted"""", """"almost always interepreted"""" or possibly someting like """"the current consensus is that it is"""" and they would all probably be acceptable.  Consensus is an opinion.  Present it as fact and you are pushing POV.  Unfortunately majority POV is generally accepted as no POV on WP.  That is a serious flaw, and a significant hit to WP's credibility.  Also, it take at least two to edit war.  It does no good to cry """"foul"""" when another editor is as determined as you are over a differnce.

'You people are unbelievable in your ignorance and the ease to which you get brainwashed by subversive propaganda.
 Learn to read. I said that Paine and Jefferson came up with the ideas for a minarchist government whereby the freedom and equality of the people would  be protected. Have you read Paine and Jefferson? You are attacking the wrong men. If you want to rightfully attack an American forefather attack Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, and others.
 I never said they were anarchists. I do say, though that Jefferson expressed his admiration for anarchism. If he had suggested it at a congressional meeting he probably would have been shot or lynched or they just would have impeached him. (Something that many of them wanted to do anyway.)
 Being patriotic to your country and anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Sounds like you have been reading too much Communist propaganda. Communists just love to subvert governments and China is trying to subvert this one right now.

I have created an adoption program to help teach my adoptees. I give out tests that are graded and looked over twice and a classroom so my teachers can help teach students. I would like many peoples opinions on this. talk 
You've only been on Wiki for a month and you have an adoption program? Am I missing something?   
Well, I do have 3300+ edits, and I'm trying to edit more on the mainspace more. Any comments? talk 
I think that this is ridiculous. You are not at all an experienced user, you have only 312 edits in mainspace, only one page move. Do you know the fair use policy, the naming conventions, the banning policy ? etc. I see that you want to become an admin when you'll have over 5000 edits, well, you should look closer at recent RFAs.

I don't mean to be offending either, I see that you encourage people to give their opinion (the review etc), I just give mine. Something is wrong too, why have you chosen this page to post your adoption program ? It's meant to be a user talk page (cf the corresponding policies/guidelines), it's not the community bulletin board. Back to the adoption program, I think that you should wait several months before working on this. If you wish, we can continue this discussion, somewhere else.  Talk

 It's amazing the amount of ignorance concerning Martin Luther. Early in his life he was a stalwart defender of the Jews, saying

and 

""""Absurd theologians defend hatred for the Jews. ...

What people fail to put together is that Luther suffered a tremendous decline in health in his old age (Iversen OH (1996). """"[Martin Luther's somatic diseases. A short life-history 450 years after his death]"""" (in Norwegian). Tidsskr. Nor. Laegeforen. 116 (30): 3643–46.) and decayed into senility. It was in this state that he challenged the canonicity of the Book of James and even recanted his faith on his death-bed. He lost his mind in his old age. Medicine had simply failed to progress to the point where they could diagnose it at that point in history. His later comments should not be privileged any more than the average institutionalized individual. It's very sad that people who wish to defame Luther take such a narrow-minded view of his illness and comments in order to discredit him.

The thing is that Saying that the Vedas permit beef-eating and cow-slaughter amounts to striking a lethal blow to a Hindu’s soul. Respect for bovine or livestock animals is a core tenet of Hinduism. But, Once you are able to convince a hindu of flaws in the foundation of this core tenet and make him feel stupid/guilty, '''he becomes an easy prey for the predator faiths. There are millions of ill-informed Hindus who are not empowered to counter argue and hence quietly surrender (and convert).Vegetarianism is an integral part of most schools of Hinduism. The Vedas are also accused of animal sacrifice in sacrificial ceremonies popularly known as the YAJNA. Interestingly a section of home-bred intellectuals claiming to have deep study of ancient India has also come up, who cite references from works of western indologists to vindicate such untrue accusation against the Vedas.The Vedas have not condoned the practice of killing animals anywhere,. But, due to the rise of dilettantism fused with a plethora of societal changes, influence of external cultures and severe lack of awareness about real Vedic injunctions, the role of religion has withered over the years.

But alas, thanks to all the slanderous and conjectural accusations heaped upon the Vedas that can be attributed mainly to the interpretations of commentaries written by Mahidhar, Uvat and Saayan in the medieval times; and to what Vam-margis or the Tantra cult propagated in their books in the name of the Vedas, animal Sacrifice is rashly associated with Hinduism (as if the religion itself promotes violence against animals).

In the more recent times, Swami Dayanand Saraswati – known as the grandfather of modern India – interpreted the Vedas as per the correct grammars of the language and authentic evidences. His literature, which includes commentary on the Vedas, Satyarth Prakash (loosely translated as """"Light of Truth""""), An Introduction to the Vedas and other texts led to widespread social reformation based on Vedic philosophy and dispelling of myths surrounding the Vedas.Some verses of Vedas prohibiting killing animals:Some verses from other Hindu scriptures prohibiting Killing animals:'''

 Yep.  This is one of several cases where the vast majority of the time the pattern is met, it is indeed vandalism.  (I suspect something like 99% or better, but have no actual data behind that, so it's really just a guestimate.)  There are a small number of cases on this and some other of the bot's criteria that are actually false positives.  The error matches a vandalistic pattern, but is actually not vandalism.  In general it has been decided that this is a small enough price to pay for the good that the bot does in rapidly reverting the rest that are indeed vandalism.  In general the bot is supposed to run in Friendly mode, where it will not edit war.  This means that if you get hit by a false positive, just make the edit again and remove the warning from your talk page.  The bot should not revert a second time on the same edit.
 As for refining, that's tricky.  What was there about those two edits that a bot, a computer program, could have used to identify them as not vandalism?  Sure, the bot could be programmed with the very specific examples of those two edits, but the next time won't be exactly the same.

 You People... 
...Are hoping, begging and wishing for previlages, respect a title that you did not earn, go by on your own and are not deserving of.  You did not build the US, you had the Spanish Empire and it failed, not you come here by crossing the border and by boat.  Stop fooling yourselves.  BEFORE the first Spanird came to the Americas, they already had black blood and Asian blood in them!  This is why they are darker.  This is why on the paintings from the Colombua period they had yelolow hues, dark hair, curly hair and full lips.  Yeah, Isabella was red, but Spaniards were never one type of European to begin with.  On top of that, as the Moors got defeated (not actually kicked out of Spain altogether), more Europeans came into the mix and reintroduced whiteness.  NOW, the mulattoized peoples still remained as it is today, especially in Portugal, France and Italy.

Once the Spaniards came over here, mixing was let loose, UNLIKE the rule in the USA!  See, the US was operating on whiteness and a white 'purity' concept.  You guys were operating on being greedy and grabbing land and not knowing what to do with it.  You mixed with the natives and the Africans.  It is more than clear.  In fact, it is so clear that that is all you see.  Only after the US established itself as THE word power (and broke down Spain's empire.  How come they did not do it to France..?), THEN you people started trying to think of yourselves as white.  That only increased as you immigrated to the US and it broke your hearts when you found out that you were not white and landed in the ghetto.

If you sad mixed people don't get it by now - AMerica does not settle for mixes or those who cry about being white, you are or you are not.  If you have noticed in US history and society in general, Spain and Portugal are hardly if ever mentioned in a context with Europe.  You ask the average American where Portugal is they can't tell you.  They may have heard of some people (usually black) calling themselves Portuguese, but have no idea where or what Portugal is.  Spain less so, but white is not associated with Spain.  Even Europe is hardly associated with Spain.

All of this BS about you guys being more pure than American whites is just that - BS.  People know that you are hispanic.  You don't - you can't fool anyone.  Only very few of you look like a 'no questions asked' white person.  I can understand your pain, since many Greeks and Italians are regarded (not exactly accepted) as white, even though clear non-European/African traits are visible.  I guess you would ask """"if they can be white, then why should I not be?""""  Good question, but you people are not doubt mixed and recently.  Italians and Greeks may not have a direct black parent, but you can look at them and see that African beneath the surface.  Some African is on the surface more than the white is!  

Sadly (for those of you with white dreams that is), you are lumped together with the rest of your latino brothers.  Just because things are not going well n ALL of those (so much land and resources) countries, you want to come to the US and get a free ride as whites?  It does not work as easily for you as it may work for others.  One, you ARE NOT coming from Europe, so there is no built-n perception of whiteness based on Europe alone.  Two, you are mixed!  You need to review the history of the US!  Once you do (the 20th century alone will do), you will see that you need not apply as white.  Only the absolute whitest (dying your hair blond or red does not fool anyone for your information) need apply.  You just can't come to a country and get a free ride.  You have ALL of Latin America, instead of making something out of that, you want to come here and try and be white.  No, no.

I still cannot believe how many Puerto-Ricans, Dominicans, Chileans, Argentines and so on truly believe themselves to be white.  I met a femle who thinks she is white.  I keep telling her it is only in her world because it is not in anyone elses.  Spain IS in Europe, but despite popular thought, not all Europeans are white.  You can do your best to lie about the Moors, lies about African savery in Latin America and lie that there was even race-mixing going on, it does not change history and biolgy.

Also, I was already well aware of the hispanic trick of calling white people Anglos, meaning """"your type of whites as opposed to my type"""" which whites don't care about.  You are not seen as white, you are seen as hispanics.  This is why you are (along with Italians and other black mixed Europeans)quick to (try) and be 'racist'(renegade mulatto is more like it) against blacks, thinking that it pleased whites and that it somehow makes you feel white in your mind.  Being white does not mean being a racist.  White is an American (USA) thing.  Most Europeans never thought of themselves as beinga part of a white people.

It's too hard for me to puzzle through all the German text relevant to this case (which Google Translate handles far more poorly than Chinese or Arabic, alas).

 Blatant Racist editing 

Hi Mentifisto

You kindly acted on a report just now of vandalism on Sol Campbell [diff] by  User talk:86.153.188.51. I thought such blatant racist editing would receive an immediate block as per 
Wikipedia:No personal attacks rather than just a 1st level warning. Please can you advise how I should act in future, many thanks  
Well, in that case the edit had been made some time prior and the latest was not clear vandalism so the IP may have possibly be reassigned but generally I think it's best to give them a  warning so as to prepare them.  fisto 
Hi Mentifisto, Thanks for your feedback and I am truely sorry to trouble you again but I am left even more confused and need to know where to refer to to get an understanding of the line is drawn on racism on Wikipedia. The IP used the term stupid n*****r (in caps) at 20:38 on 16th May. This to me is just as bad as it gets. I reported this to WP:AIV at 21:19 and you applied the warning at 21:20. I can only assume you looked at the later edit to Didier Zokora which was not obviously that offensive to me at least. Thanks   
I am also a little confused. I agree that there is a fine line in dealing with personal attacks. I simply would like this line pointed out so that we will know how to deal with it in the future. Thanks,   
Well, I think it's down to individual discretion; blocks are preventive, so if the IP is unlikely to commit another similar edit in the next ten minutes or so it'd be somewhat redundant. Personally I'd give them the above immediate final warning so they know the consequences of their actions.

Again, I disagree. Scholarly consensus has been moving towards the direction of inclusiveness (particularly for the question of the Roma and the disable). In fact, as you go through modern academic literature (the last 20 years), """"Holocaust"""" more and more includes non-Jewish victims. Just an example: Alex Callinicos, from York University, (2001) The Holocaust isfor good reasons I need not rehearse heregenerally held to be the most extreme case of human evil. All the different kinds of domination fused together in Auschwitzracism, directed at Jews, Slavs, and Roma; the economic exploitation of slave labour; the oppression of gays and women; the persecution of dissenting minorities such as Communists and Jehovah's Witnesses. Or Slawomir Kapralski, """"Identity Building and the Holocaust: Roma Political Nationalism."""" I have already mentioned Sybil Milton (who was a senior historian at the Research Institute of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum), and Henry Friedlander, a leading Holocaust historian in the USA, is another important voice. This increasing consensus has had an impact on common language , as well on political bodies. See this press release from the UN, for instance. It is not a question of ranking victimsit is the concept of hte holocaust as a racist, mordern project, and the common fate of the victims. The famous pictures of Mengele's twins are of Roma children. The technology and expertise for mass murder was developed for the disable in the T4. The tactics of Eisengruppen were first developed in the invasion of Poland, against Polish leaders. I have seen several good arguments that convinced me of the centrality of Jews in the Holocaust; I have never seen a convincing argument for their exclusivity.
If this is not enough, let me try in another way: by deciding to describe the Holocaust as an 'exclusive' Jewish event, wikipedia is taking sides in a ongoing scholarly debate (I could say on the 'declining' side of an ongoing scholarly debate). this is NOT holocaust denial, with no legitimacy in the academia, and it must receive more than mere lip service in the body of the text or in the footnotes. At very least Wikipedia must admit the existence of debate in the lead ""","""
If this man was upset because of Israel, Hezbollah and the war in Iraq, wouldn't it be politically motivated violence? Please note, that in the west the term """"Muslim"""" (after 9/11) carries a lot of political weight as well. 

The above are very good points. There is another point:

This article is now considerably less lame than a month ago. However, the problem I still have with it is that the way the various POVs are presented implies that the fate of the peace process depends on the goodwill of the Palestinians, which appears uncertain, and hence Israel is the victim of their apparent duplicity. Let's be real: Israel is the occupying force here and has far, far greater military might (not to speak of economic power). The Palestinians are virtually mendicants. Hence it is ludicrous to quote Faisal Husseini calling for """"the liberation of all Palestine from the river to the sea"""" without placing it within the governing geopolitical reality: Israel is armed to the teeth, backed by the even more powerful USA, and has between 200 and 400 nuclear warheads. 

Your anti-Israel political rant is of no help here. If you can't be productive, then why are you here? Please do not start a fight. 

I would like to see the material in this article merged back into the parent article under the section """"The Peace Process"""".

Dougweller, Okay, I can see that you're not going to respect my wish. The """"attacking"""" was done by SamEV. (Whether you're ever going to admit it or not.) As mentioned above, he claimed that the Italian unification gave Italy a king, not a president. I proved to him that the unification gave Italy both. He further claimed that Spain ruled Naples, Sicily and Sardinia during Columbus's time, and he sent me about five Wikipedia articles that he said would prove it. (And called me ignorant!) I did not care to look at his articles, as he might have changed them deliberately for his own self-serving needs. So, instead, I went to Wikipedia's """"Italian Renaissance"""" article, and I found it stated that during the Middle Ages (1300-1499), Naples, Sicily and Sadinia were ruled by the Arabs and the Normans. This seemed more on the right track to me. On Monday, I borrowed a book about the Italian Rennaisance from my local library. In truth, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia were governed mostly by the Arabs and the Normans during this time. Spain was involed in it with the Normans. The Norman kings and queens were marrying Spanish kings and queens, in these parts of Italy, and future rulers included second and third generation nobles who were born on the Italian peninsula. All said, Spain had a bit to do with these parts of Italy at that time. It's generally accepted that the lion's share of it all belongs to the Arabs and the Normans. SamEV's gross exaggeration about Spain ruling these areas, at that time, is a sad reminder that people who edit on Wikipedia are not always using the exact truth. Now, regarding SamEV's attacks. I was raised, in what I believe, is the correct way. The majority of people agree, that calling someone """"ignorant"""" is offensive and insulting. (Dictionaries often point this out.) Unfortunately, there exists a minority of people, who, with mean-spirited intention, will call people such names, and, then, hide behind a false angelic face of well-meant wisdom. I don't buy this type of mentality! SamEV, says above that """"it's no crime to be ignorant"""". Well, he, himself, was ignorant when it came to some Italian matters on this website. I wonder how long it takes to become a """"rookie"""", like SamEV, himself, on Wikipedia. Pertaining to the vernacular...I'm not interested in slang (or attempts to verify it)! In the future, I, like many people, will prefer to go to the library and search for a good book on the topic I happen to be interested in. This website has that """"too many cooks spoiling the soup"""" feel to it, and in most cases, the articles are not accurrate. The librarian, I spoke to on Monday, had this to say: """"Oh, Wikipedia? It's a joke!""""

Now, karmafist, you and I both know that there are people who think it is acceptable to replace the contents of Snoopy with, say, """"Snoopy is a shitfaced cockmaster.""""  I disagree with those people, and I'm sure you do, too.  In fact, there are lots of people who doand they refer to the aforementioned individuals as """"vandals"""".  However, they are never blocked for this.  Since, according to you, """"being an asshole to people who disagree with you"""" is a blockable offense, it follows that one of the following must be true:
Calling someone a """"vandal"""" does not constitute being an asshole, in which case I should not have been blocked because by calling deletionists (who disagree with me) """"vandals"""", I was not being an asshole to people who disagree with me.
Your statement that it is unacceptable to be an asshole to people who disagree with me is false, in which case I should not have been blocked because assholery is in fact not unacceptable behavior.

Or perhaps you meant to say that because someone disagrees with you is not ipso facto sufficient reason to be an asshole to him.  Again, one of the following must be true:
Calling someone a """"vandal"""" does constitute assholery, in which case one can infer (from the fact that those who refer to the Snoopy types as """"vandals"""" have never been blocked for that) that it is acceptable to engage in this specific type of assholery towards those who are indeed vandalsand, as I proved on User talk:Aaron Brenneman, deletionists are indeed vandals (you claimed that my proof was """"bullshit"""" and that it did not need refutation, but your assertion does not make it so)
Calling someone a """"vandal"""" does NOT constitute assholery, in which case it's all irrelevant since, as I was not being an asshole, the conditions under which being an asshole is acceptable are not an issue.
Calling someone a """"vandal"""" only constitutes assholery if it is false, in which case see the above-mentioned proof as to why that is not the case here.

Now, which of these alternatives is it?  Alternately, you can show me a fallacy (if I were you, I would try and find a false dichotomyor trichotomy, for that matteras my argument rests on showing you how none of the possible conclusions of your argument justify a block on me; perhaps you will be able to find an alternative I have missed that does indeed justify blocking me) or a mistaken premise and I will gladly concede that my behavior was wrong and was deserving of a block, and will change in the future.

Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying """"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do"""", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I """"breed cancer"""", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge.

You say """"but saying you are Jewish doesn't imply religiousness"""" and I immediately accusing you of doing exactly what you accuse others of doing - imposing your meaning of what """"Jewish"""" means. That's what you said was original research, isn't it? Milliband obviously recognised that simply saying """"I'm Jewish"""" would mislead at least some hearers into making a religious assumption - which is why qualified his self-identity. Now if you label him as """"Jewish"""" - and stick him in an unqualified Jewish box, you leave open the very misinterpretation that he was at pains to exclude. And you do it by saying """"here is how I define Judish identity"""" and worse by ignoring the fact that some/many people hearing """"Jewish"""" don't share your preconception. The subject has said what the subject has said. We should record it.

Nice Pic
Ah good old Max Schreck... talk 
...and I should thank you because that picture led me to read his article, which led me to a religious/vampire/lesbian/Canadian movie (with a luchadore) that I now must see. talk 
I'm not really happy with that picture; its low resolution doesn't work well in the size I'm using on my userpage.  But I have to work, and don't have time to search for a better Halloween picture, so Schreck it is.  It is a cool picture; I just wasn't expecting it to pixellate quite as much as it did. - (talk · contribs) 

Seen the movie, met the director, met the star, eaten at the restaurant with the extra-garlic shawarma.   
I have totally added that movie to my Netflix queue. - (talk · contribs) 

Wish I could provide more feedback than that, the memory of the film has been washed from my mind.  I do remember the shawarma though, a very tasty shawarma indeed.  My tastes run more towards teenage sweedish lesbians and boy meets girl, boy beats girl.  Incidentally, I love the poster on the latter page, so perhaps I lack the moral authority to criticize Creepy Crawler.   
I have seen, and loved, both of those movies. - (talk · contribs) 
Secretary was a fantastic movie.  I've not seen Fucking Åmål, but I think I shall.  Shawarma is OK, but I've always been more partial to a nice lamb kafta sandwich with tahini and pickles or Shanklish, olive oil, mint, and cucumber on pita. talk 
My girlfriend has an insane aversion to garlic so I rarely get to indulge in Middle-Eastern cuisine.  I've considered leaving her over this matter, but who would pay her half of the rent? It's a tough decision, garlic versus rent, one that I take very seriously.  FA was really just a very conventional teen romance movie, but with lesbians instead of heterosexuals.  Think The Breakfast Club, but with two characters, both with breasts.  Secretary was instrumental in helping me realize that James Spader wasn't a douche, though I wouldn't go out of my way to see any of his movies past or present.   
Indeed.  I used to live very close to the ByTowne Cinema in Ottawa, which contributed towards my excellent taste.  Now I live much further away and sadly the last movie I watched was Blades of Glory.  I was drunk at the time.  Now I'm sober, and filled with shame.   
I stumbled onto FA one night and couldn't turn away.  Something magnetic going on there.  |seriously|folks

Let me state a fact: if you think """"Religious violence in India"""" has nothing to do with anti-Hindu violence, then I will move it to Violence by Hindus in India against other ethinicites. Then we will debate about what should be here, and what should go there. If you are disagreeing with the fact that anti-Hindu violence is real, then you should get your facts correct (and wikipedia here will not help you, unfortunately). Google is full of webpages, until you subscribe to Ad_hominem#Ad_hominem_circumstantial, common around here, then it will be a littler harder to find. Haphar's theory of what is religious violence and what is not is his own theory, and as such he is entitled to have his own opinions (""""POV"""", a wikiaholic would say) - while they stay out of the article. I am personally entitled to my opinion that his theory is laughably ridiculous - Islamic terrorism - enough said. Regarding having found books about religious violence in India, who is saying it is not present in India? I am saying that no such country exists with two different religions coexisting, and no act of violence ever happening. Having found books doesn't make it worthy of having an article about it.

What it does attain, though, is a major part in the discussion. Your rejection of anything else is incorrect.

I hope that you might also realise that if in your words the case here is """"thankfully relatively rare"""", why many people would then think that applying a blanket measure such as Flagged Revisions is not very appropriate at all. I contrast it as the British Government contending every citizen must be forced to carry an identity card, on the presumption that is the best way you can catch terrorists, which happen to also be """"thankfully relatively rare"""". Why not for example in this specific case take a more intelligent approach, and implement sopmething that prevents or flags any edit that adds the word """"molesting"""", instead of forcing onto all BLP articles an incredibly blunt and incredibly bad faith assuming measure? (and any interested observers, please, stop before you say it, these valid concerns with what FR is/could be cannot all just be washed away by referring to the quite irrelevant 'advantage' of FR of opening up the tiny minority of protected articles).

And to further address the specific example you give, maybe you can expand on why anybody would be likely to believe that one sentence claim, when it was added to the article along with another 15 sentences, which at best hint at the whole thing being a hoax, and at worst, screams delete me now for being total WP:BOLLOCKS. We can also discuss how an editor in between the vandalism and your removal 'fixes the article for typos'  without noticing that it is 90% complete bollocks?

 User Un-friendly Administrators 
Anyone interested in having a look at what's going on here may want to check this link to my previous user talk page which concerns accusations by Guy Chapman that I am supposedly a spammer which is a false accusation. Just because I have been evaluating whether I should start contributing in Wikipedia or not, does not make me a spammer. All I have done is to try """"replace"""" factual information which I have written that was deleted and hence turned into fiction without any discussion in an effort to give a totally distorted view of events concerning EC0PAVE by this and """"other"""" administrators. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fact_Finder,  

What exactly are you doing here?  

No sorry, Im trying to put a notice on the page for reasons why it should be deleted,  

But you are making hundreds of posts on a page that is no longer current, I'm not sure what your goal is, I just ran into the page by accident, and nothing makes any sense.  

Its ok now, im sorry Armadillo ive finally worked out how to place a notice on a page which I am requesting for removal, maby thats what happened, hundreds of posts? no no, I have only placed a removal request on three articles in question have a look at my contrib log,  
Oh I know what you are talking about now, yeah youre right in a sense because when I was editing (writing) the article on Accusations that EC0PAVE has spammed...I made numerous edits, I know I know, in the future I will write them down using my word program and spell cheker first before I add articles to a Wikipedia page, Im learning  
This is what I added to the help page but someone has deleted it today  ,

I am still waiting for the deletion of these 3 articles on the grounds that they have been edited to a point where the facts have become fiction and these three remaining articles serve no other purpose except to make the company EC0PAVE and people look bad and they dilute the trademark protected words Trademark dilution and the article is in bad faith;

 Accusations that Ecopave Australia has spammed in Wikipedia are incorrect and false 

Why am I responding to these accusations? because this could also happen to any one wanting to contribute into Wikipedia, I have raised some serious issues that if left un-addressed, could potentially cause serious harm to someones professional or academic reputation as a result.

My understanding after what I have been told by EC0PAVE, is that their people wanted to contribute into Wikipedia """"in good faith"""" by adding articles about their company and products in the same way as many other companies have done in the past like for exampl","""The person who said that it was hit by a missile was the brother of someone on the airplane. Clearly he is going to be emotional and not a worthwhile source. The fact of the matter is that the first patrol to come across the wreckage was asked to investigate because the Joint Defense Operations Center on base detected the sound of the plane crashing into the ground. Bear in mind that the sound detector is used to listen for mortars and would hear a """"missile"""" hitting the aircraft. Also, the reason the JDOC sent the first patrol to investigate was because the cameras that observe around the base were obstructed by the fog. This was the thickest fog I have ever seen. My section was the second section to be called up to respond to the crash. The first section to go out picked up the two barely surviving individuals and my section picked up the bodies with the pararescuemen. I was driving and I could barely see 75m ahead of my truck. There is absolutely no way that the enemy could spot the plane in the fog and shoot it down. Shooting down an aircraft is not an easy task for insurgents in the first place, shooting down a plane in that thick of fog, with a """"missile?"""" (insurgents don't have missiles), and having a """"missile"""" that doesn't make a sound is not possible and should not be given any credence. Also, the plane did not crash """"1.5 miles"""" from the base. The hull of the plane and all the wreckage was about 200m from the fence, consistent with an attempted landing. You seem pretty smug and sure of yourself but the fact of the matter is that all you did was read reports from unreliable Russian websites and fancy yourself with conspiracy theories.

death to critics

So instead of  'every' earlier, now you are giving isolated cases, such as Theo van Gogh, Vincent van Gogh, Rashad Khalifa, and Irshad Manji who received death threats or were killed by anonymous unknown radicals.  What happened to every claim? Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji. Then you need to post evidence that this was consensus among Muslim scholars on each of these cases.  Without that, you don't have any case, and you are refuted once again  09:33, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I also provided examples of critics who were murdered by MUHAMMAD himself. Al-Azhar is not a higher authority than Muhammad.

No, you have only provided two stories in Ibn Ishaq about Muhammad that are rejected by Muslims, such as rejected here.  Al Azhar and Muslim scholars will interpret what Muhammad did and what Islamic law says, not an anti-Islamic bigot like you. You made a bold claim that in Islam critics are to be to be killed. I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence. After that, you need to provide proof that that judgement was a consensus among Muslims scholars. You didn't do that. You were refuted once again. Since you are an anti-Islamic bigot, you can't just claim that Muhammad did this or that or Islamic law says this or that and expect that claim to be inserted in Encyclopedia. You need to provide proof. You couldn't because you were wrong. Try again, dude. You have failed quite miserably here  03:40, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Furthermore, whe opinons of secular governments are irrelevant - of course Musilm countries rejected the death fatwa against Rushdie, but this was due to international politics, not due to religion. Also, as stated before, Ayatollah Khomenie was a Shiah CLERIC. The only way to be an Ayatollah is to be born as one. Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings. This does not mean by any means prove that Al-Azhar was right, and Khomenie was wrong. The fact that KHomenie was a shiah cleric, while Al-Azhar is a sunni university is also a  gaping hole in this argument. You have no ev",0.0,3.0,0.0

That is absolutely false.

That was the only time that you posted there, ever, for this issue.
My reaction to that, was to come here to ask what happened.
We discussed it here, and when the discussion ended, without any result, I removed the civility warning from my talk page, because I use to archive / remove old conversations in my talk page.
Automatically, wen you saw I had removed the civility warning, you blocked me for a 24 hour period.
Your block was absolutely illegitimate, for various reasons:
The way you did it:
The reason you gave to block me was: """"Yes, I've seen the comment on your talk page. This was the combination of mine and his responses to your previous question."""". And few minutes later, you posted """"24 hour block issued"""".
All this information was posted in your own talk page, and talking to another user.
You did not communicate to me that you had blocked me. I did not see that you had blocked me until, few days later the block had expired, I came to your talk page, and saw that you had said that you had blocked me.
In addition, by not communicating me that I was blocked, you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block.
The reasons why you did it:
It is not stated anywhere in this Wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page.
You neither told me not to remove that stuff.
I accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude. Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude.
I also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request.
In all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I've explained above.
And since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.
In addition, you are threatening me. Read well what I wrote:
""""Hello? Why did you block me? Since when removing a civility warning from one's talk page is something that deserves a block? You did not even communicate my block to my talk page. I am stil waiting for a justification of your abusive attitude as admin. You not only block for no reason but you also ignore people's requests of justification!"""".
Where do you see a lack of respect here? Where do you see that I """"keep"""" an uncivil attitude? Honestly, you are the one being uncivil: """"if you carry on in the line you are takng, you will be blocked again"""" ... which line I am takng? And why do you threaten me? """"If you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing"""" ... oh, """"we"""". This sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian, than an admin giving wise advices to a poor Wikipedian. Go to my user page and see the articles I've created. Isn't that a positive contribution?
Look: I am not being uncivil; it is you, the one being disrespectful with me. And I am not ignoring your requests of being civil; I am fulfilling them.

The nomination of the article about the London/English riots for deletion is probably the most asinine nomination I have ever encountered in Wikipedia.

Tony, thanks for the apology. However, it really doesn't alter the fact that Wikipedia as a body has been entirely hypocritical in regard to sceptics of global warming.

And very soon as the """"consensus"""" on subjects change as real facts (and not opinions of people calling themselves """"scientists) come to light, the right wing press will have a field day highlighting the embarrassing way Wikipedia got it wrong in so many areas.

As you have chosen the grounds, you are also responsible for providing the boat on which the pistol duel will take place. If you are unable to find a boat with a large enough deck to accomodate an honorable duel (at least twenty paces of unobstructed space in a corridor ten feet wide) another option is that two smaller boats may be used, in calm seas. Inflatable rafts and non-motorized dingheys are not acceptable.

David Duke was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to David H. & Maxine Duke. As a Shell Oil engineer his fathers frequently moved his wife, David, and his sister Dotti to numerious locations around the world. The Duke's spent a short period of living in the Netherlands before they settled in Louisiana. Young David became interested in the white nationalist movement at an early age and joined the Klan in 1967. Duke went on to study at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and in 1970, he formed a caucasian campus-group known as the White Youth Alliance. That same year, he made himself known even more by demonstrating in swastika regalia to protest William Kunstler's appearance at Tulane University, LA. He was involved in the campus ROTC, until he was kicked out due to his radical beliefs. In 1971, he went to Laos to teach English to Laotian military officers and serve on cargo flights for Air America over the course of ten weeks.

Duke returned to LSU, graduating in 1974. He became notorious on campus for wearing a Nazi uniform, Ku Klux Klan apparel, and swastika paraphernalia while picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of the birth of Adolf Hitler. The year of his graduation, he was elected Grand Wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He attracted attention for trying to modernize the Klan and turn it into a modern nationalist political force. For example, he changed the title of 'Grand Wizard' to 'National Director' and sported a conservative suit as opposed to the traditional white robe. 

In 1976, Duke sought a seat in the Louisiana State Senate as a Democrat. In 1978, he left the Klan and two years later formed the National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP). In 1987, he conducted a direct-mail appeal using the identity and mailing-list of the Forsyth County Defense League, in Georgia, without permission, which League officials described as a fund-raising """"scam"""" (detailed in The Rise of David Duke by Tyler Bridges). In 1988, he ran in the Democratic Party primary for President of the United States. After a dismal showing in the Democratic primaries, he appeared on many state ballots as the nominee of the Populist Party and received  approximately 25,000 votes in the 1988 general election.

Using the pseudonym Dorothy Vanderbilt, Dr. Duke published a self-help book for women titled Finders-Keepers in 1976. The publication gives advice to women regarding vaginal exercises, fellatio, anal sex, and anilingus .  The manual is no longer in print and hard to find, however “The Picayune”, a local Mississippi newspaper, managed to find a copy and trace the trail of it’s proceeds to the original  author via the publisher.

In the 1980s, he was heavily involved in gambling and stock market investments, which were covered by the Times-Picayune, as well as by others.

And nobody has PROVED the accuracy of the article. The part about Gwen not being able to pass was culled from many people that knew Gwen well and stated that Gwen could not pass. In the Rolling Stone article, it was mentioned that Gwen could not get a job because of her visible transgendered status, in other words, that she was clearly a biological male. Most Photos of Gwen look to be a biological male made up as a female. You can insist over and over that this is not the case, but it clearly is. Gwen was also attacked weeks before by people who clearly recognized her tyransgendered status. Yet we are supposed to believe that almost everyone Gwen came into contact with knew she was transgendered until she met up with these three men and their group of friends?? Somehow they were magically oblivious to what most others can clearly see? 

[QUOTE] That doesn't make her """"dangerous behavior"""" a way to wink and say, """"well, she got what she deserved"""".  [/QUOTE] 

I NEVER implied that Gwen deseved to be murdered, and that is a sick contention of your part! Gwen clearly engaged in behavior that put her at great risk of someone raping, killing or beating her. When the Transgendered do not have a support system in place, and by that I mean qualified professionals as well as understanding friends and family, they are at great risk. Gwen's family, as well as friends, were no doubt sympathetic and loving, but Gwen had no other support or therapy. Gwen should have been in a support group at the very least, and perhaps been transitioning after therapy before attempting to passing in public, which is very dangerous in most places no matter how passable the person is or believes themselves to be. Yes, these guys are scum, and thats even more reason to take any motivation they claim with a grain of salt. But the bottom line is: Gwen should have been more cautious. 

And lets honsetly answer the question once and for all: Was Gwen wrong in not revealing her gender status before having anal sex with some of these men (And it has been widely reported that it was anal not oral sex!). I find it impossible to believe that if it was indeed oral sex that not one of these purported hetrosexual males made a boob grab! This whole situation does not pass the smell test!

It seems that either you do not understand, either you are of bad faith. Let's make it simple:

According to Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem, 1972), not I, the great argument of the Reform rabbis in Frankfurt (1843) was """"God ordered circumcision to Abraham, not to Moses""""; in other words God's COMMANDMENT to Abraham is circumcision, God's COMMANDMENTS to Moses do not order circumcision; in other words:

- God's One Commandment to Abraham = circumcision.

- God's Ten Commandments to Moses = not even one for circumcision!

The rabbis, not I said so! Therefore, wholly and seriously documented, I wrote it into the main article but WP and S rub it out. This is an insane violation of the wiki rules.

Now, in order to enlighten the main article, the 2nd Commandment topic of this """"Discussion""""  introduces my """"discovery"""" (a child would do it). It says:

- God's 2nd Commandment to Moses orders him: """"Do not circumcise.""""

But, contrary to the saying of PW and S, I never attributed this to the Reform rabbis.

Conclusion: who forgot to take their medicine, for several days now? Not I!

The ethical question involved about this discussion is: """"How can the wiki support a very obviously childish lie just because this lie has been carried along for millennia?"""" Think about it! If you are responsible persons, you cannot publish an obvious lie without warning your readers, which I am doing.

Sigi's request to WP and S: """"Circumcise your heart, eyes, ears and pen, not your peco!"""" because yes, this criminal violation of Moses 2nd Commandment is being done every day in the USA to baby boys. It even has been done to an Oregon girl, in 1950 (see http://www.aesculapiuspress.com/ - Books – The rape of innocence); indeed a good American mother cannot want her beloved daughter be deprived from circumcision when her beloved son gets it, can she?

Well, Guy, I was going to ask you why, if I have been blocked, what your interest was in it, and why there was no notice to that effect by the blocking administrator here on my talk page.

But then when I come to post that, I happen to glance at the jumble of a signature there and see that the """"Guy"""" who was posting on my talk page was the same as the """"JzG"""" who appears in my block log.

So then the question becomes, why the third-person passive-voice nonsense?  What's this """"Right now you have a block of 7 days"""" stuff, as if you are informing me of someone else's actions?  You blocked me.  Just say soespecially if you are going to twiddle with your user name so that what I see in the notice is something different from what I see in my block log.  I almost mistook you for some well-intentioned soul who thought that he was going to offer to help out in some unspecified way in my reeducation.  Some helpful, innocent bystander with a """"Help!"""" button in his signature for some reason or anther.

To say that one cannot raise an issue and claim, on a forum for making such complaints about the actions of editors such as WP:ANI, that an editor's actions have been rude and inconsiderate (or even aggressive, your word, if I had said that), is ludicrous.  It is totally contrary to all sense of fairness and due process, on Wikipedia or anywhere else. Raising such an issue is clearly not a violation of WP:CIVIL, whether or not in your subjective opinion  you can find some excuse for that actionbut you haven't even bothered to try to do that.

But you also seem to have entirely missed the point of the issue I raised at WP:ANI.  Rlevse's actions in disrupting the process are not wrong becasue he was incidentally rude and inconsiderate to me in doing so; they are wrong because they are bad for Wikipedia.  They are wrong because they corrupt the process of the various dispute resolution network we have.  They would have been wrong if he had been pleasant and nice to me and had tried to discuss things with me and actually accomplish something, rather than blocking me out of the blue.  The fact that he was rude and inconsiderate is irrelevant to that issue.  I even pointed that out there, and don't understand how you could have missed that.

You are instead assuming bad faith on my part, in addition to not paying any attention to the actual issues raised there.  You have turned a blind eye to the issue that was raised, just because, for whatever reasonand I don't have a clue what it isyou have taken a dislike to me. Not a good foundation for any discussion.

But then, you aren't really interested in discussion, are you?  No more so than Rlevse.  No, in fact, much less sohe didn't block me to keep me from responding to anything he had said. He merely didn't say anything, anywhere. You, OTOH, have blocked me specifically to stop me from addressing your response or anyone else's on the WP:ANI discussion, and the subsequent one on WP:AN.

The disruption of WQA was done to give an advantage in content disputes to User:Greg L, who had already had a Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts on his own actions at Kilogram, filed by User:Enuja in [this back on 1 September, before I ever got involved in that discussion there.

Pissed off at the shitty booking, Benoit confronted booker Kevin Sullivan(who benoit had a personal history with re: Nancy). Sullivan then told Benoit if he didn't like the booking he could ask for his contract release no questions asked. benoit took him up on it and jumped to the WWF. The difference between this and the millions of other screwjob/Dusty finishes was that rather than the belt seemingly moving from one champion to the next, then being handed back....the bgelt was vacant before Benoit """"won"""" the title, thus the overturning of the decision made the belt vacant once more.

Okay, so Vinnie Mac has bought at WCW and recognised both Benoit's and Sid's first wins as World Title Wins. He has also recognised Hulk Hogan's two AWA Dusty Finishes as official World Title Wins.

Well in that case the Wiki rules should be enforced.

Also Greenfield was quoting directly from Federal Law and what was put into the Sarfatti article was completely distorted out of context. In any case it is obvious that several of the Wiki Admins have violated the basic Wiki rule of objective fairness and they all should recuse themselves and leave it up to Ed Poor, Jimbo Wales and the Wiki board as a matter of integrity and fairness.

7456,6935,8996,""": Recently a group of I.P. addresses were used in order to engage in vandalism, disruptive edits and nonsense edits against this article, in addition to engaging in harassing behavior, apparently due to ideological motivations.

 In the edit summary of your second edit of this article, you incorrectly state that """"Clearly there is some dispute about the accuracy and neutrality of this article. This tag should not be removed until this dispute is resolved."""" What there was was this group of I.P. addresses engaged in vandalism and other disruptive behavior, with one person (69.230.175.35, with possibly this same person using one or more of the other I.P. addresses) ending the """"dispute"""" with an act of vandalism in addition to the message """"You know what fuck off [some Anglo-Saxon name]. I want to see how much you can take before you crack.""""

 So in fact there had been no authentic """"dispute about the accuracy and neutrality of this article"""". The """"Omega Point (Tipler)"""" article is accurate in describing the Omega Point Theory, with thorough citations provided. The article follows Wikipedia policy of WP:NPOV, as the article does not claim that the Omega Point Theory is true, but instead is written in the neutral point of view: it describes the Omega Point Theory, but it does not claim that it is correct. The article uses neutral-point-of-view language, such as """"According to Tipler from a 2005 paper in the journal Reports on Progress in Physics, he outlines the following reasons why he maintains ...""""

 In the edit summary of your first edit of this article, you state """"Obvious really, who the hell is repeatedly removing this categorisation?"""", referring to the """"Category:Pseudoscience"""" edit added by said person or persons engaged in vandalism, nonsense edits and disruptive edits. Your edit summary falsely makes it seem as if this edit has long been in the article, and that it has just recently been removed, which is incorrect. Your edit here also violates Wikipedia policy, such as WP:Truth and WP:NPOV. Prof. Frank J. Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been peer-reviewed and published in a number of the world's leading physics journals, and so under WP:Reliable Sources does not qualify as """"pseudoscience"""". Your phraseology of """"who the hell"""" also violates WP:Civility.

 You claim WP:Undue Weight for the latest factually-incorrect edits, yet almost the entirety of the peer-reviewed paers in science journals are in support of the Omega Point Theory. There has only been one refereed paper in a physics journal that was critical of Prof. Tipler's Omega Point Theory, but the authors of that paper unwittingly gave an argument that unless the Omega Point comes about then the laws of physics are violated, and so thereby actually gave a powerful argument for the Omega Point Theory's correctness. Tipler cites this article in support of his Omega Point Theory in his 2005 Reports on Progress in Physics article.

 Regarding critical reviews of Tipler's books, none of them have been refereed in science journals. They are book reviews that have not undergone the referee process that is required of actual papers.

 Prof. Tipler and his Omega Point Theory have been in the news recently. This has drawn the attention of ideologically-motivated people who upon hearing of it take an extreme visceral dislike to it. Because of this, this article and its associated talk page have recently been subject to vandalism and other disruptive behavior.

 Therefore, due to the foregoing reasons, you are here requested not to further engage in such factually-incorrect and Wikipedia-policy-violating edits.

 I will start a """"Criticisms"""" section which details the above information, but do not add factually-incorrect and Wikipedia-policy-violating tags to this article.

You are being a hypocrite yourself in the regard that you yourself violated Improper Consensus Building when you ignored the discussion dating back from December 2009. You are simply abusing user power then accusing me of doing so. You also ignored my requests to wait until an Admin settles this, and then lied saying that """"I want to work together with you"""" when it appears you have no intention. The record is all there. Why you continue to lie in the face of the record being present is appalling. You yourself need to read this: How experienced editors avoid being dragged into edit wars. The Administrator will see in the record that you continue to ignore, that you made zero attempt to engage in discussion. You need to read this carefully yourself:
[is consensus?]
How not to achieve consensus
Don't edit war.
Don't simply state your position over and over, without explaining your underlying concerns and interests.
Don't canvass other editors who agree with you.
Don't give up when people disagree on a specific proposal.
Don't take a hard line position to extract concessions from other editors. This often backfires, and undermines the reasonableness of your viewpoint.
Don't question the other party's motive.

Proposals:
1) change phrasing in intro
2) do not change focus of the majority of the page on the """"close circle""""
3) perhaps make """"writers"""" section more reader friendly for casual readers with a chart, or something quick and simple to read
4) change naming of """"writers"""" section to something reflected broader scope
5) I would like something like 3 & 4 to be closer to the top, but I do recognize Doom's concern that it weighs down the intro, so we can see for now if it works.

I'm suggesting no change beyond that, but I feel I have provided the beginning of sufficient evidence to support the necessity of this change.

7524,7031,7891,""":::Even during the 1891 census, castes like Vilakkithalavan and Veluthedan were counted separately. 90% of the Nairs counted in 1891 belonged to the Kshatriya divisions. The remaining 10% were caste groups wrongly claiming the Nair status. Moreover, the 1891 census in Kerala was conducted by Iyer Brahmins, who had a deep seated resentment towards Nairs (Iyers were treated much below Illathu Nair and Swaroopathil Nair in Travancore caste system and they were not allowed to perform priestly functions). Since all the original castes composing the Nair supergroup were Kshatriya and none of the historians considered the primary occupation of Nairs anything other than being soldiers, there is no reason to change the introductory phrase. As pointed out in the reference, the Nairs were commonly referred as Kshatriyas (whether it is accurate or not is another question) by historians. KN Panikker, probably the most famous historian from Kerala, calls them """"a Dravidian variety of the Aryan Kshatriyas"""". Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya calls them """"Nagara Kshatriyas"""" in his book  Downfall of Hindu India. The question is not whether the much researched Nagvanshi origin is accurate or not. It is whether Nairs were known as Kshatriya during the last millenium. And the answer is yes, from multiple sources. 

However the caste system is the most complex in India, and this is the reason why Swami Vivekananda called Kerala a mental assylum. In Kerala, the son of a King can never be a Kshatriya, as according to Nambuthiri beliefs, a Kshatriya should have a Brahmin father and Kshatriya mother. This is the reason why the so called four """"Suryavanshi"""" dynasties of Kerala always married off their females to Nambuthiris. These clans were known as Samanta Kshatriya and were regarded as equivalent to Kshatriya by the Nambuthiris. It should be noted that the Nambuthiris considered every other caste as Sudra, even the other Brahmin communities. The pollution time period (pula) gives an indication to this. Nambuthiris observed 10 days of pula (6 days in some places). The caste which is immediate next to them, the Samanta Kshatriyas observed 11 days of pula. Top most ranked Ambalavasi Brahmin communities like Elayathu and Moosad (unlike other Ambalavasi Brahmins like Maarar, these two castes were recognized by the Nambuthiris as a part of Brahmin community) observed 12 days of pula. This means that the position of Samanta Kshatriya was intermediate between Nambuthiri Brahmin and Ambalavasi Brahmin. The next higher ranking ones were some insignificant divisions of local Brahmins like Pushpaka Brahmins, who observed a pula ranging from 13 to 15 days. Higher ranking Chandravanshi and Nagvanshi Nair groups (all of the Samantans, most of the Kiryathils and most of Illathils) observed a pula of 15 days. Lower ranking Nairs (like Swaroopathil and Charna Nair) observed a pula of 16 days, so did Iyers and lower ranking Ambalavasis like Maarars in Trivandrum (In Palghat Iyers never observed any pula traditions and were independent on their own). 

Regarding the claim that people were granted the Nair title, I don't think a sufficiently large number of people belonging to other castes were granted the Nair title. A few occurrences are there in Travancore, where during the 18th century a very small number of Iyers were granted the Illath Nair status. During the 18th and 19th century a small number of Vellala and Maravar people were granted Nair status. Other than that there has been absolutely no """"conversion of caste"""". The Portuguese record an incident, during 16th century when a Portuguese captain asked the Cochin King to elevate the status of some lower castes to Nair, the King told him that even the highest ranking Emperor does not have that power. During the end of 19th century, however as the Nair dominance was on a steep decline, a number of servant castes asked the Iyer census takers to count them as Nair, which they happily obeyed. And for a brief period, some of them even added """"Nair"""" or """"Pillai"""" to their surname, until the Kerala government nullified affirmative action benefits to all those who are having such a surname. These groups came not only from the Sudra division, but also from other divisions. These groups included Brahmins like Maarars, GSBs and Pisharodys (In Travancore, where Ambalavasis are having a lower status), Vaishyas like Chettys (in Travancore) and Arya Vaishyas (in Malabar) and even other Kshatriya communities like Marathas and Bunts.

In my own defense: A man has a right to his opinion. I do feel Timothy Usher is a bigot. I do feel that Jews are screwing up the planet (though admittedly Muslims, by far, surpass the Jews in their capacity to destroy things). Look at history. Only recently has it become the norm to like Jews. That only came about after certain countries (eg America) adopted them as the collective dame-in-distress needing shelter and protection. Sort of the precursor to the chihuahua. Before then, Jews were hated in Europe and America alike..And everywhere else. We all know Jews were once banished from most culturally superior European countries. The only reason why Poland took them in was that they had loads of money. Probably the same reason why Washington panders to the now. Point is, alot of people dislike Jews. I'm entitled to, so long as I don't demonstrate that dislike on articles dealing with the topic of Jews. We don't penalize people for not liking things, do we? His Excellency...

What does everyone think about moving the photo of him as Bond to the top? It's current, and it's a much better picture. Sure, the top one is more real, but it's a little too real.

Introduction to US audiences
I don't know if it's correct to say that the Lara Croft film introduced him to American audiences. I remember hearing some buzz about him in Elizabeth which while it didn't do Lara Croft-level box office, was still a substantial success in North America. Thoughts?  

I hadn't heard about that, but it's no big deal to me either way. I made the change because the text as it stood made it seem that Road to Perdition was his first introduction to US audiences, which on the evidence of Tomb Raider was manifestly untrue. If there is clear evidence of Elizabeth'''s priority, I have no problem with that.  
I'm not familiar enough with Elizabeth to be certain. I do know it was listed as one of his career highlights more often than Tomb Raider when he was announced as Bond; the only time I saw Tomb Raider connected to him in the media was when it was rumored Angelina Jolie was up for the role of Vesper.  

While it's probably the better film — and was even nominated for the Best Picture Oscar — from memory his role in Elizabeth is a relatively minor one. Certainly he wasn't one of the main stars (who were pretty much Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes and Craig's Our Friends in the North'' co-star Christopher Eccleston).

The category """"Noahide Religions"""" is extreemly misleading Rambam doesn't say Muslims are Noahide just not idolworshipers.A Noahide (Ben Noah, Chasid Umot haOilam) according to Rambam and others is someone who officialy accepts the 7 Laws and observes them.According to letters of the Rambam Islam is herecy, a false religion started by a false prophet:
Mohammed the False Prophet - Islam the False Religion

Rivka Olenick 

""""A prophet will the Lord, thy God raise unto thee, a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren."""" Deuteronomy 18:15 
The false prophet, the navi sheker, the """"madman"""" Mohammed, as the Rambam calls him, convinced his followers of Islam that there are several verses in our scriptures that allude to his being a prophet. The Rambam states: """"These arguments have been rehearsed so often that they have become nauseating. It is not enough to declare that they are altogether feeble; to cite as proofs these verses is ridiculous and absurd in the extreme. Neither the untutored multitude nor the apostates themselves who delude others with them believe in them or entertain any illusion about them. Their purpose in citing these verses is to win favor in the eyes of the Gentiles by demonstrating that they believe the statement of the Koran that Mohammed was mentioned in the Torah. The Muslims themselves put no faith in their arguments, they neither accept nor cite them, because they are manifestly so falicious."""" 
Mohammed claimed that Deuteronomy 18:15 specifically refers to him. He said that it was he who God arose as """"a prophet from the midst of thee."""" Of course, he himself nor anyone else ever found one word in the scriptures that proved that Mohammed arose as a prophet. Yet, he and his blind followers accuse us of manipulating the text of the Torah. They ignorantly claim that we purposely removed every trace of the name of Mohammed from it. However it was they that would not accept the main precepts of the Torah, out of defiance to the Revelation at Sinai. So in great desperation they created a book that horrendously warps and taints our scriptures and undermines Moses as the greatest Prophet. After all this they attempted to legitimize the Koran as a book of truth. 
Isn't it amazing that exactly what they accuse us of - """"altering"""" the Torah text - is exactly what they altered when they made up this """"imitation"""" and called it the Koran. What they believe is so obviously false, yet the world is convinced that this is a book of truth only because of the vast numbers who read it, and not because it contains any real truth. The Rambam says: """"Therefore, all the nations instigated by envy and impiety rose up against us, and all the kings of the earth motivated by injustice and enmity applied themselves to persecute us."""" There arose a new sect, which combined the two methods of conquest and controversy, into one, because it believed that this procedure would be more effective in wiping out every trace of the Jewish nation and religion. They claimed to prophecy and found a new faith, Islam, contrary to the Divine religion and to contend that it was equally God given. Thereby it hoped to raise doubts and create confusion, since one is opposed to the other and both supposedly emanate from a Divine source, which would lead to the destruction of both religions. For such a remarkable plan contrived by a man who is envious and querulous. He will strive to kill his enemy and to save his own life, but when he finds it impossible to attain his objective, he will devise a scheme whereby they both will be slain."""" He slays them both because he really knows that he cannot destroy God, but he cannot tolerate God's Divine word and so out of his own insanity he kills those who represent God and kills himself believing he will enter paradise. 
The Torah states that the prophet that will arrive """"from the midst of thee"""" is a person that will keep the Torah in tact as it was given to us by Moses from God. The Ninth Principle of our Thirteen Principles of Faith states: """"I believe with perfect faith that the Torah will not be changed, and that there will never be another Torah given by God."""" As it says: """"Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it."""" Deuteronomy 13:1. 
""""A prophet will the Lord thy God raise unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren."""" Islam took this sentence completely out of context and made inferences. All the statements before and after must be understood so that the meaning and purpose of the statements is known. The sentence quoted above was taken from a paragraph in Deuteronomy that specifically warns the Jewish people about the prohibitions of soothsaying, astrology, divination, sorcery, etc. The Gentiles believe they can manipulate and use these practices in ord",Why don't you mind your own business?

7709,7320,12715,"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

One of the reasons the article is being flagged for being too big is that people aren't BRANCHING to other links where there are CITATIONS supporting THOSE PARTICULAR POSITIONS. One DOESN'T HAVE TO RE-INVENT THE LIGHTBULB everytime one needs a new lightbulb.

2) I fixed the broken link. And if you had bothered to READ the sermon/discussion between Branham and Billy Gramham, you would have found in paragraph 40 this """"trinities"""" statement...

40 Jesus come three times. He came the first time to redeem His Church. He comes the second time to receive His Church. He comes the third time with His Church. EVERYTHING IN THE BIBLE TRAVELS IN TRINITIES, THREES, but all in one Christ. He... Remember, the first time to redeem His Church, the second time to receive His Church, the third time with His Church, as King and Queen.
Now, but on His first coming, we'll speak of just a little bit, and then on His being here; and then on His second coming; on Hisand then on the third time; if the Lord willing.

(And if I could figure out a way to link directly to that paragraph, I would.)

The problem with Branham's statement is that not every triunism is a """"trinity,"""" which is a confusion of terms.

Scholars ALSO use the term """"typology,"""" but usually only in twos.

I'll add more references from the THOUSANDS of them out there later.

3) You demonstrate your ignorance of the Bible and Jewish traditions: Citing that John said Jesus """"went up to the feast of the Dedication which is held in the winter,"""" i.e. HANUKKAH, is NOT """"original research."""" ANYONE WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THE BIBLE (which you don't) KNOWS that """"the feast of the dedication that is held in the winter IS HANUKKAH. And you DON'T NEED CITATIONS to CITE A STATEMENT OF FACT (especially when there is a link to the """"Hanukkah"""" page).

4) Citing that John spoke five kingdoms that """"were,"""" one that """"is,"""" etc. is ALSO A STATEMENT OF FACT. And the concept of TRIUNISM/TRINITIES/TYPOLOGY is ALL OVER CHRISTIAN LITERATURE.

Do not blame me! -) I could not figure that out (why someone do not like the wording """"local defense line"""" especially most of them in daily cloths) plus the logic of other things (considerations other than the history, I guess) that is happening on this page. If this would be my history, I would not be reckless on my heroes. Whaetever.  

I removed it because I thought that it came from the Battle of Van and not the Van Resistance.   

Ottoman, could you please type the entire passage from Robert-Jan Dwork Holocaust: A History by Deborah and van Pelt, p. 38, that talks about the 1st Armenian Republic? This doesn't sound right, but I want to see where it's coming from. 
Nowhere on that page it talks about the first Armenian republic. It does indeed talk about the Armenians. It first talk about Max Scheubner, it also quote from him. Then talk about the ten commandments of the Ittihadists and the Turkish government plan of destruction of the entire Armenian community. Then, the only thing which is the closest to what Ottomanreference attribute to that page is this following passage: Through the use of centralized planning and modern communication systems, all Armenians were to be assaulted. For the Turks, the sole question was: When? They did not have long to wait. In spring of 1915, Russian troops invaded Turkish territory following a failed Turkish offensive in the Caucasus. Sensing the opportunity, nationalist Armenians established a provisional government in the Russian-occupied era. Here was the proof of the """"internal enemy"""" the Turks had long claimed them to be, and Enver Pasha, the Turkish minister of war, did not hesitate to... Then the rest of the page relate to the destruction of the Armenians. This is also another example of a footnote not supporting the text it is supposed to source.  (ix) 

The book is at the state library; I have a very short note. It says; """"page 38, the setting of the provisional government"""". It was in the introduction section of the book about Holocaust (Jews) and talking about WWI in general. Next time; when I am at library, I will get the text.

Sorry, but I'm not here to appease your """"getting offended"""" radar. If you feel offended every single time someone is critical of Jews, such as Kevin MacDonald, you have a serious emotional problem, or, you're probably Jewish. MacDonald has himself to blame? Wrong. MacDonald has written three scholarly books on Jews, Judaism, and Jewish political movements. That's his right to do so if he wants to and he should not get into trouble because of it, since, last I checked, the 1st amendment was still valid in America (or so they say). What next? You want to criminalise political criticism of Jews too? Anyway, this is what the source states:

They were both artists with their own style, and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested.

 Pallava are Brahmin 

Pallavas are brahmins. They have made many inscriptions claiming that they are are brahmins of Bharadvaja gotra. Hence Pallavas are not considered as tamil kings.

Then what happened to the decendants of the Pallava kings in Tamil Nadu?

Pallavas never claimed as brahmans at the start of their power. Later only some Pallavas left some inscriptions as they belonged to Bharadwaja Gothra.

Hey, we should really start warning that Angel 850 with stern warnings, I honestly don't think he's going to stop until he's blocked and well, you know the route we have to take before that can be done, I really don't feel like edit warring *sigh*  

I don't mind and edit war, I've got both copies of the TCC and GSC saved so I'll just paste them in if anyone makes any vandal edits.

 Demonising Turks 

It is obvious from certain Wikipedia articles that many people are using it as a vehicle to demonise Turks. Wherever possible articles derogatory to these people are being written, media and writings manipulated so that when a search is done of Google - only one version - a completely Christo-Armenia, Greek Othodox version can be found. It is seems that as in America, Armenian and Greek lobbying is alive and well here, too. What a shame that Jews, who found solace in the Turkish Ottoman Empire, while the rest of Europe was have progrom festivals have come on board, too. It seems that all that it needs to get the Jew and the gentile on the same wagon, is to beat the tired old donkey issue of the barbarious Turk.

It wears thin.

To be honest, I don't want Turkey to join the EU. I want you and teh editors and admin that are like-minded to carry on with your actions. We need to perpetuate the misnomers and misrepresentation of the Turks. Forget the Royal Academy's exhibition last year about these people. We need to keep isolating them.

M, This colon convention gets out of hand after maybe two. 
I've just looked over the articles you suggested I might take an eye to. We will have something to discuss, I see. You don't take on small issues! Much more daring than I am. 
I can have more to say later, of course, but first impression sis that there may very well be POV objections to most of these on grounds of opinion. Now that's inevitable in any sort of political or historical analysis and the best anyone can probably do is scratch a little rhetorical dirt over the most blatant. It's the basis for academic debate in these disciplines. Politics, though, is important, not just scholasticim redux and so it's worth doing. Enough blather. 

I see a major problem in that your perspective is too temporally narrow, POV allegations aside. I trace the Big Break (realignment or whatever) in American politics to the Bull Moose. Until then, both the Republicans and Democrats were broad parties with support from all classes, regions, etc (well, the Solid South was an exception for the obvious racist reasons, but...). When Teddy took the Progressives out in 1912, he made Wilson's election nearly certain and more importantly in the longer run, many (most) of those folks never went back. Think of La Follette or George Norris or Hiram Johnson, progressives (small p) all, and all (I think) Republicans. They wouldn't have been important or comfortable in the GOP of Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, Taft (pere ou fils) and their intellectual descendents weren't. It was the Repuplicans who staged a generations long witch hunt for Commies and unAmericanism. Even thouhg it was an idiot Democrat who started HUAC (Martin Dies  and he had a Soviet spy (!) as a fellow member  Dickstein I think it was). but the GOP found the structure conveninet to use. 
Think Nixon from his first election, or the GOP tolerance for McCarthy, Tom Delay, Newt Gingrich, Bomber Bob Dornan from California, etc. The 'Rockefeller wing' (misnamed) of the GOP was the last remnant of the people Teddy had taken out. Goldwater just made the ideological contraction more evident/blatant/inescapable. he wasn't actually very much in tune with the modern conservatives now dominating the GOP. Too independent of a specific agenda. 

This leaves the Dems as the only broadly based party, but remember that old saw about belonging to no organized party, I'm a Democrat. That's a distortion of the historic American pattern of two substandtial widely based parties, plus some minors. Maybe that pattern is changing, or not, but it's abberrant.

Enough. Have to go anyway. Tell me whether anything I've said is of any use.  23:41",Thanks for the warning.  I noticed that after Changlc reverted something twice and then Jiang came in for the third revert to block me.  Is it possible they are sockpuppets? ,1.0,2.0,0.0

7897,7617,7844,"- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.
Good riddance!!

self-selected audience. If I had wanted to stuff the ballot, I could have laid in hundreds of notes to polarized user groups from random ips, instead, I spoke to 40-or-so by hand of a fairly neutral group who were directly affected by this ridiculous proposal.  

Also, citing an arbcom ruling rather than policy shows how contrived this is.  Mindspillage asked me to reconsider, he said nothing about policy or blocking. How can you say inviting participants to a Wikipedia-wide issue is disruptive?  How can you say that I should somehow have known that? The real question is, why is this thing not on the main page? The answer is, because most would oppose it, but the anti-userbox admins think they know what is best, and are pulling every trick they can to cram this through.

If you want to design either a jury-pool process or a general election process to decide such things, I'll be happy to help you.

How is this a personal attack, except to note that the mass blanking happened and the perpetrator is documented?  Face it, the ban came only because what I said is unpopular with admins. MarkSweep made hundreds of blanking edits using admin tools, speciously twisted rules into knots and disrupted hundreds of users. He got a slap on the wrist, and polite applause.  I've received notes from admins on this page threatening me for suggesting that his actions constitute vandalism, which they clearly do.  I pass a note pointing this out to a small subset of the hundreds of users affected, I am banned for 31 hours.  How is this not political? Now I'm afraid to contact my own friends here, whom I know to be against this, but do not know about it.

Tacky? Pretending this proposal is put before a representative audience is tacky, as is the slash-and-burn approach taken in the first place, as is the attempts by MarkSweep to fit me with a gag until the end of UPP (that is REALLY tacky), as is the naked political calculation on my AN/I as to how this speaks for their pet proposal, and how it should be played.  The fact is that this proposal will never have community assent because of its deep flaws, and I am resented for pointing this out.  Tacky is pretending in the face of all evidence that there is a basis for consensus here.

-

So they made it about VNam and thanks to our BRAVE HONEST HEROIC Swift Boat Vets for Truth, it was! LOL! (With additional props to Dan Rather.)   
-    
- In 2006, the dems and their liberal enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Iraq figuring it gave Dems an edge.

- And thanks to Senator John Kerry, the Dan Rather of 2006, this year's election is about Iraq.

- Except not quite the way they intended. LOL!!!   
-    
-    
-    
- And no, saying it was 'joke' just won't cut it.    
-    
- This latest Kerry outrage totally fits the LONGSTANDING pattern of Dems hating and denigrating our troops. From Kerry's GI Joe outfit testimony before Congress in 1971 to Dennis Kucinich, to Howard Dean to a San Francisco (where Nancy Pelosi is from) supervisor saying we should SHUT DOWN our military, the antipathy is indelible.   
-    
- And saying, 'Hey! I wasn't trying to insult our troops, just our Commander in Chief!'   
- only makes it worse. The American Legion certainly isn't buying it.

see above will hysterically, shout as loud as possible that I vandalized a wiki article by
correcting a typo AND threaten to ban me ...

This has been in fact routinely esp done by entirely crazy, lunatic Doug Weller over and over
now for approx 18 months by this person who should be in an insane asylum esp for his
stalking me about wikpedia for that time, with such entirely uncalled for and entirely
psychotic hysterical attacks.

This all origniated FROM a single, passing meaningless comment about his addition to an 
article on standing stones, a subject he knows quit a bit about, when i in effect
said he had made a dumb remark... an innocent and in that case accurate remark
but MINOR criticism, ... now 18 months later, this extreme insane lunatic
has harrassed me all that time and brought in pals who are as extreme crazy as he is
to harrass and further esp stalk me and my family ... 

GET A LIFE nut jobs ... !!! but for Weller your harrassing and threatening 
and esp stalking including my children and family means this... you are soon out 
of the picture....

and how any such lunatic could claim to be a Yalie, Eli Yale , means 
yep you were once smart but morphed into such a lunatic (see above
and all your endless threats v. me and harrassment of my family
that you have ZERO judgment JUST AS a lunatic would not have any judgment

Next, let me be clear: Mr. User:Aboutmovies vandalized an article. Then he argued with and ultimately attacked Pcap, the editor who reverted the vandalism. Then Pcap, presumably out of frustration, asked me for help, as I was the one who had provided most of the original text for that article.  I am not active much anymore on wikipedia, so I mostly just I commiserated on Pcap's talk page. I told him I would not get involved. (Why am I not active? Because there are too many assholes like User:Aboutmovies allowed to run free, making life shitty for everyone.)  

Now Mr. User:Aboutmovies, apparently having too much time on his hands, snoops through my personal communications on Pcap's talk page. And so, after putting his nose where it doesn't belong, he gets his nose out of whack, and comes to my personal talk page, and attacks me. Why? This guy clearly owed Pcap an apology. He could have offered an apology. He could have quietly slunk off with his tail between his legs, and repented in private. No, instead of doing the right, honorable thing, he instead chooses to attack me. (So who is escalating? He is.) So I called him an asshole, which he richly deserves. So then he escalates some more: he gets you to block me.  You were sucked right into his game.  You did not bother to do any due diligence. AT ALL. You should have blocked him, not me.  Once you realized your mistake, which Pcap points out to you above, you could have offered me an apology, turned around, and blocked Aboutmovies instead. Did you bother to do any of these things? No.  You fucked up.

Year: 2008
Director: Anonymous
Aspect ratio: 1.5
Synopsis: The film begins with a knock on Lara's door. The man, whose face is not seen, is welcomed by Lara. They talk about how the day has gone. The film then skips to a scene where Lara is seen from the man's point of view continuing their talk in a bar. Slightly intoxicated at this point, the man slips a few Rohypnol tablets into her drink. All becomes a blur, then the film skips to a scene of a visibly confused Lara in a dark, unidentified location. Her facial muscles struggle to move as she clearly tries to resist, in vain, the advances of the man who begins tearing her clothes off. Soon afterwards, the man drops his own clothing and proceeds to insert his bare erect PENIS into her rectum without lubrication. After some struggle from the woman, she eventually concedes and gives in to the constrictions of the phallus, which by this point is starting to gather fecal matter along the course of its shaft. The film ends with a closeup of the unknown man's semen resting at the entrance to her rectum.",0.0,3.0,0.0

Your response confirms to me that you have obviously sided with the other users who attacked me. Perhaps Users such as Blixx are good friends of yours. Given this then it is impossible for me to get treated fairly as you are apparently biased towards them. I find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing, blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have blocked me from emailing. All because I complained about my treatment, lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen, you just don't like it when I diagree with a point of view. Are you following the orders of Blixx and co? Yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me - they have called me 'a nasty piece of work', 'an islamist', 'Haddad's puppet' etc. Have you even warned them? I think not.

-TABSaving 300 000 lives against the odds, the pressure and the sheer logic, if one is criminally antisemitic through and through, is a fact sir. 
-TABDismantling the Iron Guard, a declared antisemitic and pro-german organization, is another paradox
-TABMarying a Jewish lady as an antisemit, doesn’t make sense
-TABAllowing the Jewish community to have official representatives, to befriend at least one of them, the lider of that community and to lend him an attentive ear and to let him convince you to change some of the previously issued orders and laws, does not, again, fit into an antisemitic profile. 
-TABAllowing some of the deported Jews in Transnistria to be repatriated, is not, again, an act of an atisemite. (It is another unprecedented act; can you quote one single similar occurrence in an Europe under the german boot?)

Please explain this. My request is NOT rethorical. I do agree on your superior erudition in the matter, for all I know, you might be a historian, whereas I am just interested in history. And PLEASE don’t refer me to other books, reports, authors. Just give me your own opinion on the points above. Not your opinion that they do not matter, but how do you explain them? I accept your patronizing unpleasant as it may be, if you’ll just explain. 

And try to see my point: I DO accept the possibility of being wrong. I try to stay as objective as I can, but till now, I heard rather unilateral accusations, rather than specific proofs and facts. That’s the diference between us, when confronted with discrepancies, you sir seem to deliberately ignore them, because the authors you read do so; me, I start my own research. I have spoken personally to at least 50 people, who lived through those terrible times, not Jewish, unfortunately, but certainly not antisemitic. (It’s not much, but at least I did it; what’s YOUR personal research ?) They are spread over all major Romanian regions, my witnesses, covering many different trades. Not one, mind you, ever heard, much less witnessed, any antisemitic violence ORDERED BY ANTONESCU or his government on Romania – old territory. Please quote contrary evidence, first hand if possible. I confess, I couldn’t find Jewish witnesses, all my Jewish friends and aquaintances are too young for that, but I’m still looking. 

And excuse me, the accusation of “incomplete quoting” the Wiesel repport is ludicrous. Would you want me to quote the full text ? My point was that even in a report that I consider unilateral and biased (like a trial with prosecutors only and without defenders), important facts like apparently inexplicable acts of mercy and a definite orriginal Jewish policy, totally opposed to that of Germany, at a time when Germany was still all powerfull, could not be remained unnoticed. The Wiesel Commission itself, sir, could not ignore those facts; how can you ? 

The Wiesel Report allowed such colossal mistakes as blaming a whole state, a whole nation, I remember of having read the phrase “the crimes committed by Antonescu and the Romanian nation against Jews”. You never blame a whole nation, a whole population. 

 The blame sir, is INDIVIDUAL, as Frederic Forsythe says. And so is the salvation. 

An intelligent man knows that when you deal with great numbers, you have to apply statistics, over-generalization is one of the  most unforgivable acts. And such a phrase lies in the same report in which there are mentioned pro-Jewish acts, both from government level and from individuals, only to underline that they don’t count. And you want me to take such a report as gospel truth, a model of impartiality and justice ?

MR MIRCION, kindly, get a grip on yourself. To state that Antonescu is “my hero” proves you didn’t even tried to read what I wrote; if so, how and what are you criticizing ? 

I repeat, to be sure Antonescu was involved in war crimes. Commited in war zones. He was not involved in crimes against humanity, in cold-blood premeditated murder, based on an ethnic cleansing policy, on the contrary, he tried, and partially succeeded to stop it, against considerable political pressure and certainly against the major antisemitic trend in a Germany dominated Europe. He is to be condemned, of course, but NOT for the wrong reasons. At the time of the reckoning, both good and bad deeds should be put in the balance. Romanians, sir, have the right to criticize, accuse, and condemn Antonescu. Not the Jewish people from Romania-old kingdom, since Antonescu saved 300 000 of them while sending almost half a million of his own people to their death. 

To be sure, this is just my opinion, but it’s based on facts.

I hope they win the trial but there is no way they operate at a loss.  My friend operates a website that draws 500000 people per month on average.  With the same or less ad coverage as pirate bay, he earns 1 US dollar for every thousand visitors.  For pirate bay, this equates to 1 thousand dollars for every visitor they have.  They claim 25 million active members, so figure a lower number of 5-10 million per day.  This brings in as high as $10000 per day if I'm staying conservative.  This is not counting donations and likely better ad deals due to the large numbers of people being drawn and time of each person spent on the website (ie, multiple hits by a person per day).  So the amount of money being drawn in per day has a lower limit of 10 grand.  365 days in a year, unless these people are complete morons they should be bringing in at least a million per year gross income.  More likely several million.  With these numbers, if they only get a million hits per day, which is well within everyone's, including piratebay's, estimations, then they would still be making on the order of $365000 per year.  There is no way operational costs equal or exceed this value even if they bought brand new servers every other year, which doesn't seem logical given my knowledge of networking.
Now they might be incorporating expansion costs, ie the new server banks in Russia and other countries, and other related costs to expansion in costs of business when saying they operate at a loss.  Hate to break it to ya, this means they're just spending money they already earned.  So yes, they do in fact earn that much money, they just spend it as fast as they earn it.
